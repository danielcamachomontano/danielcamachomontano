periprosthetic joint infection In our defined population with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA to improve glycemic control. It is well-established that patients who have poor glycemic control have an increased risk of poor outcomes after TJA In our defined population with nicotine dependence, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA for nicotine use reduction/cessation. Nicotine use is associated with both increased medical and surgical risks in TJA In our defined population with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying TJA for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. There was no evidence for this recommendation; thus, the recommendation is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences. In these patients, delaying TJA may lead to increased instability and increased juxtaarticular bone loss or deformity, which may increase the
