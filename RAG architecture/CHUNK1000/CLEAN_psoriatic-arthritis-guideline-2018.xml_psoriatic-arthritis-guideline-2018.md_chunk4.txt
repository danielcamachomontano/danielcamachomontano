Thus, health care providers and patients should judge PsA and psoriasis severity on a case-bycase basis. For the purpose of these recommendations, severity includes not only the level of disease activity at a given time point, but also the presence or absence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of 1 or more of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, dactylitis, elevated levels of inflammation mark-ers such as ESR and CRP attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities), highly active disease that causes a major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease (Figure 2 2 The panels chose the critical outcomes for all comparisons at the initial scoping; these included the American College of
