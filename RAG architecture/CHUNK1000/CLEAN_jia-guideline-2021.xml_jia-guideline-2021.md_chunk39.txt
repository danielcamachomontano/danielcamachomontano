|---|---|---|---|
|Formal recommendation deferred|Very low|PICO 24. In patients with systemic JIA, does the presence of subclinical MAS alter the treatment paradigm?|130|
|IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are conditionally recommended over calcineurin inhibitors alone to achieve inactive disease and resolution of MAS.|Very low|PICO 25. In patients with systemic JIA and overt MAS, is biologic therapy superior to calcineurin inhibitors for achievement of inactive disease and resolution of MAS?|131–136|

|Formal recommendation deferred|Very low|PICO 26. For nonresponse or partial response to biologic therapy, is addition of a calcineurin inhibitor superior to etoposide or IVIG or plasmapheresis for achievement of inactive disease and resolution of MAS?|137–138|
