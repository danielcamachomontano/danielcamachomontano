disease and resolution of MAS for systemic JIA with MAS. There is no preferred agent. IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors have proven to be very helpful in the treatment of systemic JIA and MAS Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended as part of initial treatment of systemic JIA with MAS. The benefits of glucocorticoids for MAS often outweigh their risks, even in patients whose MAS is triggered by infection. Systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary for severely ill patients because they can have a rapid onset of action. However, although treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids may be required for disease control, subsequent glucocorticoid therapy should be limited to the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration possible. Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy in children is not appropriate because of its effects on bone health and growth Systemic JIA with MAS: subsequent therapy (Table 6 Biologic DMARDS or csDMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term
