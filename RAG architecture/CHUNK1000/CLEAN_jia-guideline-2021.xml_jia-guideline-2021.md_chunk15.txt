Concerns were expressed regarding a highly fatal lung disease observed in some children with systemic JIA, most of whom were treated with bDMARDs. Observed risk factors include younger age with MAS, a history of reactions to tocilizumab, and trisomy 21 NSAIDs NSAIDs are conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS. Studies suggest that a small proportion of patients with systemic JIA will respond to NSAIDs alone Glucocorticoids Oral glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS. In most cases, oral glucocorticoids should not be used as initial monotherapy in patients with systemic JIA without MAS and, if used, should be limited to the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration possible. This recommendation is conditional, as bDMARDs may not always be immediately
