controlled unblinded trials of tapering etanercept to 25 mg weekly versus maintaining the dose at 50 mg weekly in patients with stable AS showed that remission or partial remission was somewhat less likely among those in whom etanercept was tapered http://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract In adults with stable AS receiving an originator TNFi, we strongly recommend continuing treatment with the originator TNFi over mandated switching to its biosimilar (new, PICO 63).
