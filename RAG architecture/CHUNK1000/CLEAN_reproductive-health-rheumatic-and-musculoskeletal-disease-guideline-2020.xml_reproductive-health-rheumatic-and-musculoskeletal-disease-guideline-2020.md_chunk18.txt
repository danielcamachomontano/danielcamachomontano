to oocyte retrieval, and resumed following retrieval. Optimal duration of prophylactic LMWH for asymptomatic aPL-positive patients undergoing ovarian stimulation has not been studied; this is a decision best made in consultation with the reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. The treatment is often continued until estrogen levels return to near-physiologic levels if no pregnancy occurs. Patients with OB APS will continue therapy throughout pregnancy. Aspirin is not commonly used prior to oocyte retrieval (it will be started after retrieval if indicated) given concern that its prolonged action may increase bleeding risk at the time of the retrieval. Patients receiving regular anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists for thrombotic APS should transition to therapeutic-dose LMWH for ART (usually enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), with this treatment withheld for retrieval and resumed subsequently, to continue throughout pregnancy.
