Influenza vaccine responses are greater when the vaccine is administered later rather than earlier after rituximab Whether to administer non-live attenuated vaccinations to patients receiving glucocorticoids or with active disease (Table 4 Glucocorticoids Whether to administer non-live attenuated vaccinations to patients taking glucocorticoids or defer vaccination to a later time point to maximize vaccine immunogenicity. For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone â‰¤10 mg daily, administering any non-live vaccinations is strongly recommended. For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone >10 mg daily but <20 mg daily, administering any non-live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended. For patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone â‰¥20 mg daily, administering
