| Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with the goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission). |
| Target refers to low disease activity or remission.                                                                                            |
| Recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering.                  |
| Dose reduction refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. Gradual discontinuation of a DMARD is defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it. |</p>
