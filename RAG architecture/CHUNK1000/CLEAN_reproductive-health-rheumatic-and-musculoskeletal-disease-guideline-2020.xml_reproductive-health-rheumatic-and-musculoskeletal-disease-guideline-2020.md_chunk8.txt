and history of thrombosis In SLE patients with stable or low disease activity who are not positive for aPL, we strongly recommend use of effective contraceptives (i.e., hormonal contraceptives or IUDs) over less effective options or no contraception, and we conditionally recommend the highly effective IUDs or subdermal progestin implant because they have the lowest failure rates. We conditionally recommend against use of the transdermal estrogen-progestin patch in patients with SLE. Although not directly studied in SLE patients, the transdermal estrogen-progestin patch results in greater estrogen exposure than do oral or transvaginal methods We strongly recommend progestin-only or IUD contraceptives over combined estrogen-progestin contraception in SLE patients with moderate or severe disease activity, including nephritis, because estrogen-containing contraceptives have not been studied in SLE patients with moderate or severe disease activity.
