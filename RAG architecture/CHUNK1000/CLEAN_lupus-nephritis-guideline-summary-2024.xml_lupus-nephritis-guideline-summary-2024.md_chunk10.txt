ELNT: EuroLupus Nephritis Trial ESKD: End stage kidney disease GC: Glucocorticoids HCQ: Hydroxychloroquine MPAA: Mycophenolic acid analogs (including mycophenolate mofetil, MMF, and mycophenolic acid, MPA) RAAS-I: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) Summary: In this guideline, we emphasize the importance of prompt kidney biopsy and LN treatment and propose triple therapy as the most desirable therapy for LN, preferring MPAA regimens over CYC regimens. We propose a lower dose glucocorticoid regimen to minimize toxicity, with a prednisone goal of â‰¤5 mg/day by 6 months of therapy, and a total therapy duration of 3-5 years for those achieving complete renal response. Discussion between clinicians and patients is critical because multiple factors impact therapy choice. We do not specify a particular CNI because comparative effectiveness and safety
