should be used differently in oligoarthritis than in polyarthritis. Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) Biologic DMARDs are strongly recommended if there is inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or IAGCs and at least 1 csDMARD for active oligoarthritis. There is no preferred bDMARD. Biologic DMARDs are preferred over combining csDMARDs or switching to a different csDMARD, due to a greater likelihood that bDMARDs will yield rapid and sustained improvement in JIA Although tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are the most commonly used bDMARDs in children Risk factors for poor prognosis and disease activity measures Consideration of risk factors for poor outcome (e.g., involvement of ankle, wrist, hip, sacroiliac joint, and/or TMJ, presence of erosive disease or enthesitis, delay in diagnosis, elevated levels of inflammation markers, symmetric disease) is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions. Use of validated disease activity measures is conditionally recommended
