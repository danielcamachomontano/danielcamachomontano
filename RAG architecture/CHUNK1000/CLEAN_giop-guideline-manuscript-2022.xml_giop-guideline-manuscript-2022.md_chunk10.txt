DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV BP, DEN, and ROM have increased risk of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to oral BP Very low level evidence does not support using combination therapy (eg, PTH/PTHrP and DEN, PTH/PTHrP and BP) in GIOP. In patients with postmenopausal OP, studies have shown synergistic increases in BMD with combination of PTH with IV BP For all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over no treatment (PICO 1.4b-1.28.b, 2.4b,c-2. 17b, c In all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend against ROM and RAL therapies except in those intolerant of other OP medications, due to possible lifethreatening harms, including thrombosis, fatal stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death (PICO 1.6b, 1.10b, 1.12b, 1.16b, 1.17b, 1.21b, 1.22b, 1.23b, 1.24b, 1.25b,
