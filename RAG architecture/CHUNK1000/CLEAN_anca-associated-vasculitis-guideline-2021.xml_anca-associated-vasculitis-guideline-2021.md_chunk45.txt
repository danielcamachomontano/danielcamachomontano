The same considerations regarding prophylaxis to prevent this condition in patients with GPA/MPA apply to those with EGPA.

The recommendations for GPA and MPA are supported by a greater number of randomized trials than are currently available in EGPA. All of the recommendations made for these 3 diseases are conditional,
