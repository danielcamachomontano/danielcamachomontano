with the maximum medically appropriate allopurinol dose (determined by the treating physician). For these patients with frequent gout flares or nonresolving subcutaneous tophi, clinical trials demonstrated improved SU concentrations, low frequency of flares The above scenarios represent extremes of gout clinical severity resulting in strong "for" and "against" recommendations.

Even strong recommendations require sound clinical judgment to balance the potential clinical benefits
