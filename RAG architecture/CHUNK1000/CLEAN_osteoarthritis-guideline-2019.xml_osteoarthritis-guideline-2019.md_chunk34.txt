suggested in other contexts Bisphosphonates are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Though a single small study of an oral bisphosphonate suggested a potential analgesic benefit in OA, the preponderance of data shows no improvement in pain or functional outcomes. Glucosamine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Pharmaceutical-grade preparations of glucosamine are available and have been studied in multiple trials. However, discrepancies in efficacy reported in studies that were industry sponsored as opposed to publicly funded have raised serious concerns about publication bias Chondroitin sulfate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA as are combination products that include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, but is conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. A single trial suggested analgesic efficacy of chondroitin sulfate, without evidence of harm, in hand OA.
