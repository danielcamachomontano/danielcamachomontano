below the low-dose range (prednisone or equivalent ,5 mg daily). There are no studies available addressing this issue specifically in PMR. Based on clinical experience and because of the concern that adverse events (including disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) may be higher with divided doses, the group agreed against the general use of divided GC doses in PMR In special situations such as in case of night pain while tapering below the low-dose range (prednisone or equivalent ,5 mg daily), split doses may be considered. However, persistent breakthrough symptoms should prompt re-consideration of the diagnosis. Recommendation 7: (PICO 9) The panel conditionally recommends considering early introduction of MTX in addition to GCs, particularly in patients at high risk of relapse and/or prolonged therapy as well as in cases with risk factors, comorbidities and/or concomitant medications where GC-related adverse events are more likely to occur. MTX may also be
