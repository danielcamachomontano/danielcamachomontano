drug (csARD). The NSAID-sparing potential of etanercept was demonstrated in a recent trial In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with a biologic, we conditionally recommend against discontinuation of the biologic (new, PICO 66). In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with a biologic, we conditionally recommend against tapering of the biologic dose as a standard approach (new, PICO 65). Data from several observational studies suggest that discontinuation of TNFi after achieving either remission or low disease activity results in relapses in 60-74% of patients, occasionally within a few weeks to months from discontinuation (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlin elibr ary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract Tapering of TNFi could entail a change in either the dose or frequency of administration. Two controlled unblinded trials of tapering etanercept to 25 mg weekly versus maintaining the dose at 50 mg weekly in patients with stable AS showed that
