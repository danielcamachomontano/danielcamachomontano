frequency of screening Evidence to support the frequency of testing was limited, The Core Team and Voting Panel preferred a risk-based approach. We suggest that most people with SSc, IIM, and MCTD with SSc features should have ILD screening tests at presentation. We also suggest that people with IIM have myositis-specific antibody testing to screen for the presence of high-risk ILD-associated antibodies (anti-synthetase and anti-MDA-5 antibodies). Although we do not suggest that all patients with RA and SjD be screened for ILD, we suggest screening at presentation in those with ILD risk factors such as those specified in, but not limited to, Table 1 Monitoring for ILD progression Although screening for ILD in people with SARDs is largely the purview of rheumatologists, the monitoring of patients with identified SARD-associated ILD is expected to be a multidisciplinary collaboration between rheumatology and pulmonology. Thus, some recommendations will comment on potential variations in
