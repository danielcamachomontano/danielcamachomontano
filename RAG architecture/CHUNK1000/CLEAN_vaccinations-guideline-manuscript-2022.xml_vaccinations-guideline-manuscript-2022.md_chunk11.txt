a conditional recommendation was made to delay vaccination until the dose is lower to maximize vaccine efficacy. It is understood, however, that some patients may not be able to delay, e.g., children who require vaccination for school entry. Disease activity Whether to defer vaccination in patients with high disease activity to maximize vaccine immunogenicity and/or avoid worsening disease activity. For patients with RMD, giving non-live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended regardless of patients' disease activity. Patients with RMD often express concern about whether vaccination can induce a disease flare, but the vast majority of studies failed to show any increased rate of flare after influenza vaccination. The results were similar for other vaccinations, although the quality of the evidence was low. Strong concerns, however, were expressed among the Patient Panel about the potential for vaccines to cause a disease flare, and shared decision-making is particularly
