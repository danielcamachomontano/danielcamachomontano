despite treatment with an OSM (Table 5 In treatment-naive PsA patients with predominant enthesitis, a TNFi biologic is recommended over an OSM as a first-line option. Apremilast may be used instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient prefers an oral therapy or has contraindications to TNFi. Oral NSAIDs are recommended over starting an OSM unless the patient has cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease (or impairment), or severe psoriasis or PsA, in which case apremilast may be given instead of NSAIDs. Tofacitinib is recommended over apremilast for treatment-naive patients with predominant enthesitis. Apremilast may be used instead of tofacitinib in patients with recurrent infections. In patients with active PsA with predominant enthesitis despite treatment with an OSM (used for other manifestations of PsA), a TNFi biologic, an IL-17i biologic, or an IL-12/23i biologic is recommended over switching to another OSM. Apremilast may be used in patients who prefer oral
