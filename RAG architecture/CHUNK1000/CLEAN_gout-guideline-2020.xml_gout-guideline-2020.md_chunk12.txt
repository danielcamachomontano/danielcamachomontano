who develop incident gout. However, based on the attributable risk, 24 patients would need to be treated for 3 years to prevent a single (incident) gout flare leading to the recommendation against initiating ULT in this patient group. Initiating ULT is conditionally recommended against in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. For patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, RCTs (designed to study CVD outcomes) demonstrated significant reduction in incident gout flares over 3 years. However, the development of incident gout was low for both ULT and placebo arms (<1% versus 5%) Recommendations for choice of initial ULT for patients with gout Treatment with allopurinol as the preferred first-line agent, over all other ULTs, is strongly recommended for all patients, including those with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage â‰¥3). The Voting Panel strongly recommended allopurinol as the preferred first-line agent given its efficacy when dosed appropriately (often required doses >300 mg/day 2 2
