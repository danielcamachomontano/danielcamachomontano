strategy that includes other DMARDs. The recommendation is conditional because patient preferences and the magnitude of previous response to methotrexate play an important role in this decision. Recommendations for treatment modification in patients treated with DMARDs who are not at target (Table 4 Treat-to-target A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended over usual care for patients who have not been previously treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs This recommendation applies to dose optimization of methotrexate and to the subsequent addition of DMARDs when required. The recommendation is strong despite low-certainty evidence because of the recognized importance of systematic monitoring and adjustment of treatment to minimize inflammation to prevent joint damage, as well as other long-term sequelae including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. A treat-to-target approach is conditionally recommended over usual care for patients who have had an inadequate response to bDMARDs
