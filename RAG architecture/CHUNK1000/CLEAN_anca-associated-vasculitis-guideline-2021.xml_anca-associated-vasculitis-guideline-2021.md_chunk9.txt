patients at higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who accept a potential increased risk of infection. This recommendation is supported by data from the 2 largest trials of plasma exchange for the treatment of glomerulonephritis in AAV. The first trial, which required a serum creatinine level of â‰¥5.8 mg/ dl for entry, showed that plasma exchange decreased the risk of ESRD but did not decrease mortality However, combined data from these 2 trials show that there is probably a decreased risk of ESRD in patients with glomerulonephritis who received plasma exchange, compared to those who did not (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.98]; moderate certainty) (Supplementary Appendix 2, http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract These findings suggest that for patients with a low risk of progression to ESRD, the risk of plasma exchange may outweigh the benefit; however, in patients with a higher risk of progression to ESRD, the decrease in risk could
