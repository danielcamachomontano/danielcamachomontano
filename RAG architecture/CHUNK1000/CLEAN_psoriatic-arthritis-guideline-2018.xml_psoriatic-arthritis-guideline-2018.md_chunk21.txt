concomitant uveitis (since uveitis may respond to MTX therapy), and if the current TNFi biologic is infliximab or adalimumab (for immunogenicity prevention). Under circumstances in which combination therapy with a TNFi biologic and MTX is used and active PsA persists, switching to a different TNFi with MTX is recommended over monotherapy with a different TNFi. Continuing MTX treatment during TNFi transition was seen as beneficial because TNFi biologics may have more sustained efficacy when used in combination with MTX, but evidence is limited 25 Active PsA despite treatment with an IL-17i biologic agent as monotherapy (Table 4 and Figure 6). All recommendations for patients with active PsA despite IL-17i biologic treatment are conditional based on very-low-quality evidence. In patients with active PsA despite treatment with an IL-17i biologic, switching to a TNFi biologic is recommended over switching to an IL-12/23i biologic, adding MTX to the current IL-17i biologic, or switching to
