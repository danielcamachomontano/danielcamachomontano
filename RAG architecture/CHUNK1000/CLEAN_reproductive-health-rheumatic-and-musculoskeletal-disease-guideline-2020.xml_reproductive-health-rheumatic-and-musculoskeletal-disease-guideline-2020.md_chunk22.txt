agonist co-therapy only in CYC-treated RMD patients who receive CYC monthly by intravenous administration. Acknowledging this lack of data on oral CYC-treated patients, it is reasonable to consider gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist use for these patients. Theoretically, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy may not be necessary for patients receiving the lower cumulative CYC dose in the Euro-Lupus regimen Fertility preservation in men with RMD treated with CYC. CYC may cause infertility and long-term gonadal damage in treated men. Options for fertility preservation should be presented to male patients in whom CYC therapy is required. We conditionally recommend against testosterone co-therapy in men with RMD receiving CYC, as it does not preserve fertility in men undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy Because sperm cryopreservation prior to treatment preserves a man's ability to conceive a healthy child, we strongly suggest sperm cryopreservation as good practice for
