of, or discontinuation of, bDMARDs 86 DISCUSSION The recommendations presented herein are a companion to those published in 2019 The Voting Panel and Patient/Caregiver Panel both engaged in vigorous discussions over the use of NSAIDs and oral glucocorticoids Another major change in recommendations for the treatment of systemic JIA is the use of bDMARDs as initial treatment or upon inadequate response to a short course of NSAIDs.

Studies must be performed to obtain high-quality data to fill in the evidentiary gaps
