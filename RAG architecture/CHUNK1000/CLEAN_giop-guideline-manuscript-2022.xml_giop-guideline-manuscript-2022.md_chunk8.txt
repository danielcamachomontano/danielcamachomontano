this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are maintaining, gaining, or losing BMD, warranting possible changes in OP therapy. Yearly BMD assessment until a stable BMD is reached may be preferred in very high fracture risk patients. For adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend continuing OP therapy (PICO 12.1-12.6).  Recommendations for initial treatment (Table 2 3 For adults ≥40 years with very high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives (BP or DEN) (PICO 1.13c, 1.14c, 1.15c, 1.18c, 1.19c, 1.20c). Compared to alendronate, teriparatide increased lumbar and hip BMD and decreased vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures at 36 months in GIOP For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a
