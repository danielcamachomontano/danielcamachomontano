over mycophenolate mofetil for remission maintenance. Methotrexate and azathioprine are equally efficacious for remission maintenance Recommendation: For patients with severe GPA/MPA whose disease has entered remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate or azathioprine over leflunomide for remission maintenance. Methotrexate or azathioprine treatment is recommended over leflunomide due to the data supporting and clinical experience using methotrexate and azathioprine for remission maintenance. The data and clinical experience with leflunomide are more limited. In one clinical trial comparing leflunomide to methotrexate treatment, leflunomide treatment demonstrated a decreased rate of relapse but a higher rate of drug withdrawal Recommendation: For patients with GPA whose disease has entered remission, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate or azathioprine over trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for
