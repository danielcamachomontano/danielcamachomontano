(ACR), Spondylitis Association of America (SAA), and Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) published recommendations for the treatment of adults with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA The advent of new medications to treat axial SpA warranted this update. We did not reexamine all of the 2015 recommendations, but rather focused on those questions for which consequential new evidence was present. We added several new recommendations on how the newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. The target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA. The target users of these recommendations are rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA. METHODS These recommendations followed ACR and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology http://onlin elibr
