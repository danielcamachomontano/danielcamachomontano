recommend use of thermal modalities over no thermal modalities. We conditionally recommend use of thermal modalities, such as cryotherapy, heat, and therapeutic ultrasound, based on very low certainty evidence indicating that it results in improvement in pain and physical function. Individuals with RA receive varying levels of benefit from thermal modalities, and patient preferences are expected to vary with regard to the choice of a thermal modality. Individuals with RA can control and administer many of these modalities at home, though others may benefit from guidance from an occupational or physical therapist. We conditionally recommend against use of electrotherapy. We conditionally recommend against use of electrotherapy modalities, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and neuro-muscular electrical nerve stimulation, for RA management, based on low certainty evidence indicating that there is no improvement of pain and physical function specific to RA with
