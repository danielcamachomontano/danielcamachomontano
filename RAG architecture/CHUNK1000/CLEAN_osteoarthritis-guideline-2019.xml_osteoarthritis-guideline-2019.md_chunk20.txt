Published studies have examined various products and methods of application, and blinding with regard to use is not possible, thereby limiting the quality of the evidence. Hand orthoses are strongly recommended for patients with first CMC joint OA. Hand orthoses are conditionally recommended for patients with OA in other joints of the hand. A variety of mechanical supports are available, including digital orthoses, ring splints, and rigid or neoprene orthoses, some of which are intended for specifically affected joints (e.g., first CMC joint, individual digits, wrist) and some of which support the entire hand. In addition, gloves may offer benefit by providing warmth and compression to the joints of the hand. Data are insufficient to recommend one type of orthosis over another for use in the hand. Patients considering these interventions will likely benefit from evaluation by an occupational therapist. Modified shoes are conditionally recommended against in patients with knee and/or
