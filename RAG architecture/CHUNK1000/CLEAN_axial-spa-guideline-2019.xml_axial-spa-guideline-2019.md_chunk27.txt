an MRI in this setting. MRI could be considered in circumstances where the clinician and patient differ in their assessment of whether the disease is stable. In adults with active or stable AS receiving any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 70). In adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 83). Spine radiographs are useful for the diagnosis of axial SpA, in evaluating the extent of spinal fusion, and for investigating new spinal pain in patients with established AS. In research studies, small changes in the extent of spine damage can be detected in 20-35% of patients with AS over a 2-year interval (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlin elibr
