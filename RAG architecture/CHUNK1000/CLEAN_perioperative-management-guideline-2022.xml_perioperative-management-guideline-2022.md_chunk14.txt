once the wound shows evidence of healing, any sutures/ staples are out, there is no significant swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no ongoing nonsurgical site infection, which is typically ~14 days after surgery, is conditionally recommended. Drugs should be restarted based on the clinical status of the patient and the status of the healing wound. Although there was additional evidence to support this recommendation from the literature review, it was indirect and of very low quality across the critical outcomes. Patients with nonrheumatic diseases were included, or the study did not include a comparator group. In one study using a large Medicare data set, outcomes were better in patients who restarted infliximab within 4 weeks after surgery compared to those who restarted later, but the authors noted that this was likely because postoperative complications led to delays in restarting therapy Patients and their physicians might elect longer periods of not taking medication
