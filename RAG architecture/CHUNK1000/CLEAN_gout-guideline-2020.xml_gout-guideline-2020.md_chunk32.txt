regardless of disease activity. Certainty of evidence For patients experiencing a gout flare, we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH (the choice of colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids should be made based on patient factors and preferences). When colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects. High † For patients experiencing a gout flare for whom other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/ analgesic treatment). Moderate For patients who may receive NPO, we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH.
