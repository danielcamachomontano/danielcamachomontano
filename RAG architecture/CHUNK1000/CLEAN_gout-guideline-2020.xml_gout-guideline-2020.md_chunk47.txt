<h1>Table 3. Recommendations for all patients taking urate-lowering therapy (ULT)*</h1>

<p>|Recommendation|PICO question|Certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|
|For all patients taking ULT, we strongly recommend a treat-to-target strategy of ULT dose management that includes dose titration and subsequent dosing guided by serial SU values to achieve an SU target over a fixed, standard-dose ULT strategy.|13|Moderate|
|For all patients taking ULT, we strongly recommend continuing ULT to achieve and maintain an SU target of &lt;6 mg/dl over no target.|14|High|
|For all patients taking ULT, we conditionally recommend delivery of an augmented protocol of ULT dose management by nonphysician providers to optimize the treat-to-target strategy that includes patient education, shared decision-making, and treat-to-target protocol.|8|Moderate|
|We conditionally recommend continuing ULT indefinitely over stopping ULT.|19|Very low|</p>
