occurring after ≥12 months of therapy), we conditionally recommend continuing current OP therapy or switching to another class of OP medication (PICO 13.5-13.6). For adults ≥40 years continuing chronic GC who discontinue DEN, we strongly recommend starting an antiresorptive over not starting OP medication (PICO 13.1, 13.3, 13.5). DEN remains effective at longer than 10 years in patients with postmenopausal OP. However, discontinuation of DEN after two or more doses has been associated with rapid loss of BMD and development of new vertebral compression fractures as soon as 7 to 9 months after the last DEN dose. As such, 6 to 9 months after the last dose of DEN, BP or ROM therapy is recommended For adults ≥40 years discontinuing chronic GC treatment who have completed a course of a PTH/PTHrP, we conditionally recommend starting BP over not starting an OP medication (PICO 13.4, 13.6). Discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP medication may lead to gradual loss of bone gained over 12 to 18 months,
