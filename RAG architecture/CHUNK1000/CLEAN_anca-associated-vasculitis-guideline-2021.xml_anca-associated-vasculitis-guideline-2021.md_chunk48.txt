investigate include the following: 1) biomarker studies to identify more specific, reliable indicators of disease activity that can guide treatment decisions; 2) trials to clarify how best to use the currently available medications (e.g., dosing, duration, effective combinations, and in which population to use which drugs); 3) trials to identify novel, targeted, and/or glucocorticoid-sparing agents with minimal toxicity; and 4) long-term studies to understand the course of disease and the safety of current therapies. We hope significant progress will be made in these areas such that future recommendations provide a more tailored approach to disease management, minimize treatment toxicity, and prevent organ damage in these patients.
