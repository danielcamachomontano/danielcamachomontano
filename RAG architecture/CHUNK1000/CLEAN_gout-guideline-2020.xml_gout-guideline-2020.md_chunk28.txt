benefits outweighs the harms and costs of the drug. â€¡ For patients with minimal disease activity, the smaller potential benefits do not outweigh the harms and costs of the drug. Using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment is conditionally recommended for patients experiencing a gout flare. Using an IL-1 inhibitor over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment) is conditionally recommended for patients experiencing a gout flare for whom the above antiinflammatory therapies are either ineffective, poorly tolerated, or contraindicated.

The Voting Panel's recommendation of colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids as preferred first-line therapies was based on substantial trial data demonstrating efficacy, relative low cost (versus IL-1 inhibitors and ACTH), and tolerability
