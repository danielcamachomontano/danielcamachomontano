if other agents are not effective in controlling active, nonsevere disease, or if the patient has nonsevere vasculitis (which in some series included mononeuritis multiplex) and is positive for ANCA. Cyclophosphamide should be avoided when treating active, nonsevere disease due to its toxicity and is the least preferred option in this setting. Remission maintenance Recommendation: For patients with severe EGPA whose disease has entered remission with cyclophosphamide therapy, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil over rituximab for remission maintenance. Typically, a maintenance agent would be used after remission induction in severe EGPA to reduce toxicity and the risk of disease relapse , although monophasic disease can occur Use of methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is recommended over rituximab, because there has been less experience with the use of rituximab for remission maintenance in EGPA.
