remission induction therapies (i.e., plasma exchange as "salvage" or "rescue" therapy). Plasma exchange remains advisable in patients with GPA or MPA who also have anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Ungraded position statement: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, either IV pulse glucocorticoids or high-dose oral glucocorticoids may be prescribed as part of initial therapy. There are no trials comparing the efficacy of IV pulse glucocorticoids to high-dose oral glucocorticoids. Higher doses of glucocorticoids (such as pulse glucocorticoids) are generally administered to patients with organ-or life-threatening disease manifestations but may be associated with an increased risk of infection Recommendation: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend a reduced-dose glucocorticoid regimen over a standard-dose glucocorticoid regimen for remission induction. A recent study demonstrated that a reduced-dose glucocorticoid regimen provided a similar
