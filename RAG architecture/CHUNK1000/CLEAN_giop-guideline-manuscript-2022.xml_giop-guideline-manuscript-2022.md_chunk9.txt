≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a reduction in total and vertebral fractures at 24 months and increased hip and lumbar spine BMD compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in GIOP (evidence report, Appendix S3, page 16). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP Compared to BP and RAL, PTH/PTHrP, DEN, and ROM require sequential therapy with an anti-resorptive agent to prevent bone losses. Discontinuation of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV
