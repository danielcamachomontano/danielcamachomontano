methotrexate monotherapy is preferred over the combination because many patients will reach their goal on methotrexate monotherapy and because of the additional risks of toxicity and higher costs associated with TNF inhibitors. The recommendation is conditional because some patients, especially those with poor prognostic factors, may prioritize more rapid onset of action and greater chance of improvement associated with combination therapy Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity There is very low-certainty evidence supporting the superiority of methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD over methotrexate monotherapy in DMARD-naive patients; thus, methotrexate monotherapy is strongly preferred given the lack of proven benefit and additional risks and costs associated with the addition of a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD in this patient
