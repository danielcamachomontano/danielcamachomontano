when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM, but BP should be avoided. Use of DEN in this group may lead to prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia A limitation of this guideline is the lack of fracture data in GIOP-specific clinical trials and population studies. As such, general OP population clinical trials data were reviewed when GIOP data were not available. This introduced indirectness into the certainty of the evidence and imprecision in the estimate of benefits for treatment in the GIOP population. Because of these limitations, most of the recommendations in this guideline are conditional. Future studies in the treatment of GIOP should be powered to assess fracture risk reduction. Studies should focus on children and patients with CKD stage 4 and 5. As part of risk assessment, studies should explore the use of quantitative computed tomography (CT), bone finite element analysis from CT scans, and BMD measurements from CT colonography. It would be helpful to have validated fracture
