by embryo transfer to a surrogate is an option, if available, for patients with severe disease-related damage who desire a biologic child and are able to undergo ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, but cannot safely undergo pregnancy. We strongly recommend continuation of necessary immunosuppressive and/or biologic therapies (except CYC, which directly impacts maturing follicles) in treated patients whose condition is stable, when the purpose of ovarian stimulation is oocyte retrieval for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. This includes continuation of mycophenolate or methotrexate (MTX). There is an anticipated risk of uncontrolled disease from withdrawal of effective medication. However, there are no published data that directly address oocyte retrieval during treatment with most immunosuppressive or biologic therapies other than CYC. Fertility preservation in women with RMD treated with CYC. Although CYC is used less frequently than in the past due to availability of
