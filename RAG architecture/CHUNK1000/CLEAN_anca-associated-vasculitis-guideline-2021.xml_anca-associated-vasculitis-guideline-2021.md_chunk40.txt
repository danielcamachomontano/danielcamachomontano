or if cardiac involvement is present (see ungraded position statement and recommendation on this topic). Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over switching to another agent. For patients with EGPA with active asthma, inhaled therapies should be maximized prior to increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Although no direct comparative data are available, mepolizumab was found to be efficacious in a randomized trial in patients specifically described in this recommendation: those with relapsing nonsevere EGPA who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving low-dose glucocorticoids and no other therapy, we
