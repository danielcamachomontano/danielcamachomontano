therapies was based on substantial trial data demonstrating efficacy, relative low cost (versus IL-1 inhibitors and ACTH), and tolerability of these agents in flare management, particularly when administered early after symptom onset. Appropriate dosing and duration should be guided by the severity of the flare. For colchicine specifically, the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves). Based on similar efficacy between agents demonstrated in the NMA , the Voting Panel did not further prioritize between the first-line agents, noting that treatment selection should be driven by patient factors (e.g., comorbidity, access, past experience) as part of shared decisionmaking. Likewise, parenteral glucocorticoids were favored over alternative agents when oral dosing is not possible. In patients experiencing an inadequate response to an initial agent, the Voting Panel cited
