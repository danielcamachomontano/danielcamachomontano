proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of viscosupplementation injections. This recommendation is conditional because there may be exceptions to this recommendation, and the evidence supporting the recommendation is indirect and very low quality. The data on viscosupplementation for patients who are otherwise candidates for TJA were very limited. Viscosupplementation may place an unnecessary burden on the patient, with limited benefit on pain and function In our defined population with a BMI of â‰¥50, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <50. In our defined population with a BMI of 40-49, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <40. In our defined population with a BMI of 35-39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <35. Recommendations 7-9 are conditional
