are retrospective and not randomized. An argument against screening includes the risk of identification and treatment of artifacts that do not impact offspring health, thus exposing both fetus and mother to long-term side effects of dexamethasone; this risk must be balanced against the potentially devastating impact of CHB. All discussions should acknowledge the limited data and consider the patient's values and preferences. We conditionally recommend treating all women who are positive for anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies with HCQ during pregnancy. This is based on early and limited data and the low risk profile of HCQ. Retrospective studies demonstrate that in pregnant women with a prior child with cardiac NLE who take HCQ, there is a lower risk of the current fetus developing CHB For pregnant women with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/ SSB antibodies and fetal first-or second-degree heart block shown on echocardiography, we conditionally recommend treatment with oral
