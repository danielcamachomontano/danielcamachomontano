the panel judged that treatment with a different TNFi held a reasonable prospect of benefit and should be used in most patients, rather than immediately switching to a different class of biologics. Although ixekizumab is efficacious among TNFi nonresponders, trials have not directly compared responses to ixekizumab (or secukinumab) to responses to a second TNFi in patients with a secondary nonresponse to the first TNFi In cases of nonresponse (primary or secondary), the panel recommended against switching to the biosimilar of the first TNFi (e.g., switching from originator infliximab to infliximab-dyyb), as the clinical response would not be expected to be different. The panel also recommended against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate to TNFi in cases of nonresponse to TNFi, judging any benefit would likely be marginal. The addition of sulfasalazine could be considered in the rare patient whose axial symptoms are well-controlled with TNFi but who has active peripheral
