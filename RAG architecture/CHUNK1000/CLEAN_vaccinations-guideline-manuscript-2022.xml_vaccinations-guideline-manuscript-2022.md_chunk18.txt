after any in utero exposure to biologic DMARDs (except for certolizumab, which does not cross the placenta) The literature review identified no data on the effect of in utero rituximab exposure on later vaccine responses. Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 molecule that can cross the placenta, and it has been associated with low or absent B lymphocyte levels in newborns who were exposed during the second or third (but not the first) trimester After giving birth, most RMD patients turn to their general pediatrician rather than to their adult rheumatology provider for infant vaccination recommendations, and pediatricians may not be aware of the impact of in utero medication exposure on vaccine safety and immunogenicity.
