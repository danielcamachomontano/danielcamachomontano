is recommended to minimize glucocorticoid exposure and toxicity. Overall, there are few clinical situations in which treatment with glucocorticoid monotherapy may be considered (e.g., arthralgias or inability to tolerate other remission maintenance therapies), and close monitoring is needed if this treatment strategy is used. Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate and glucocorticoids over azathioprine and glucocorticoids or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids. The use of methotrexate for remission induction in this patient group is supported by more available data than other treatments Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate and glucocorticoids over trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and glucocorticoids. Methotrexate is considered more effective than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for remission induction, based on
