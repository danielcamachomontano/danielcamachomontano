no exercise. We recommend consistent engagement in aquatic exercise based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function but no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, the variability in patient preferences related to comfort in engaging in water activities, and the variations in the cost of, access to, and burden of aquatic exercise. We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise over no exercise. We recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise based on very low to low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function (inferred from performance measures) and pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, variability in patient preferences related to joint damage or deformities that may limit participation, and variations in the access to, cost of, and burden of
