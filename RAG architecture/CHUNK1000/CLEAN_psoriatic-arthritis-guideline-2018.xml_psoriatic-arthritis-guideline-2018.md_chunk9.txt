and only a small proportion of clinicians/patients not wanting to follow the recommendation. We use the phrase "should use" or "should be used" for strong recommendations. 2. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but a small proportion of clinicians/patients may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. We use the phrase "is recommended over" or "is/would be recommended" for conditional recommendations. We specify conditions under which the less preferred drug may be used by using the phrase "may be used" or "may consider" or "Y (less preferred drug) may be used instead of X (preferred drug)" or "may consider Y instead of X (preferred drug)" for conditional recommendations.
