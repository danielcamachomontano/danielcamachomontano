|6. Start a TNFi biologic over an OSM (specifically apremilast) (PICO 48A)|Very low|
|Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider starting an OSM (specifically apremilast) if the patient prefers an oral treatment as the first therapy or the patient has contraindications to TNFi biologics, including recurrent infections, congestive heart failure, or demyelinating disease.| |
|7. Start tofacitinib over an OSM (specifically apremilast) (PICO 55)|Very low|
