glucocorticoid regimen for remission induction. A recent study demonstrated that a reduced-dose glucocorticoid regimen provided a similar benefit compared to a standarddose regimen for the composite outcome of ESRD or death, and was associated with a decreased risk of infection http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract Remission induction for active, nonsevere disease Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate over cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Nonsevere GPA is defined as GPA without life-or organthreatening manifestations (Table 1 Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate and glucocorticoids over glucocorticoids alone. Methotrexate with glucocorticoids is recommended to minimize glucocorticoid exposure and toxicity. Overall, there are few clinical situations in which treatment with glucocorticoid
