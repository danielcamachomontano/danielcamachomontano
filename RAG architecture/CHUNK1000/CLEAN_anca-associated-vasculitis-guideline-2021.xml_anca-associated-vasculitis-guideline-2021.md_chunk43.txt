Ungraded position statement: Use of leukotriene inhibitors is not contraindicated for patients with EGPA with active asthma and/or sinonasal disease. Leukotriene inhibitors carry therapeutic indications for asthma and allergic rhinitis. As no clear causal association with EGPA has been demonstrated, a leukotriene inhibitor can be added to help manage asthma and sinonasal disease. However, leukotriene inhibitors are one of many options and are not the only choice in this setting. Leukotriene inhibitors should not be used to treat manifestations aside from asthma and sinonasal disease. Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend obtaining an echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis. Cardiac involvement is the major cause of diseaserelated mortality in EGPA Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend using the Five-Factor Score to guide therapy. The Five-Factor Score (FFS), first published in 1996 Ungraded position statement: In patients with
