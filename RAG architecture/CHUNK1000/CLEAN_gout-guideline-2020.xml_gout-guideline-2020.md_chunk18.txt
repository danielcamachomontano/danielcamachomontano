that includes ULT dose titration and subsequent dosing guided by serial SU measurements to achieve a target SU, over a fixed-dose ULT strategy, is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT. Achieving and maintaining an SU target of <6 mg/dl over the use of no target is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT. We recommend using a treat-to-target management strategy to optimize patient outcomes by achieving and maintaining an SU target of <6 mg/dl rather than using a fixed-dose strategy (Table 3 2 http://onlin elibr ary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract Delivery of an augmented protocol of ULT dose management by nonphysician providers to optimize the treat-to-target strategy that includes patient education, shared decision-making, and treat-to-target protocol is conditionally recommended for all patients receiving ULT. usual care. However, the panel recognized that these resources may not be available in all health care settings, and that the key is for
