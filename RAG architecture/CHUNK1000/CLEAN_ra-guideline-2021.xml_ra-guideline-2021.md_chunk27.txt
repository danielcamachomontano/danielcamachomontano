disease Given the variability of NTM lung disease severity and response to treatment, patients should be closely comanaged with an infectious disease or pulmonary specialist. Use of the lowest possible dose of glucocorticoids (discontinuation if possible) is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids without dose modification for patients with NTM lung disease This recommendation is based on studies suggesting an increased risk of NTM lung disease in patients receiving either inhaled or oral glucocorticoids Addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with NTM lung disease who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy This recommendation is based on the lower expected risk of NTM lung disease associated with csDMARDs compared to bDMARDs and tsDMARDs Abatacept is conditionally recommended over other bDMARDs and tsDMARDs for patients with NTM lung disease who have moderate-tohigh disease
