thought it was unlikely that patients' priorities regarding the risk of flare versus the risk of infection would have changed. The updated medication list includes medications introduced to treat RA and SpA, including AS and PsA. We have included perioperative management recommendations for the recently introduced JAK-targeted therapies, baricitinib and upadacitinib, in addition to tofacitinib. We have included new management recommendations for the interleukin-17 (IL-17) blocking agent ixekizumab, the IL-23blocking drug, guselkumab, and the novel synthetic DMARD apremilast. Anifrolumab, approved by the FDA on July 30, 2021, and voclosporin, approved January 22, 2021, were included in this guideline, although there is no information regarding their use in the perioperative period. They increase the risk of infection, and therefore the use of these medications in patients with severe SLE would merit review by the treating rheumatologist in consideration of surgery.
