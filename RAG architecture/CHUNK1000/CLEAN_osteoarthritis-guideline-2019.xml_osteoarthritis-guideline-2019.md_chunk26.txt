management (Table 2) RCTs of pharmacologic agents may be subject to a variety of limitations, including generalizability of their findings across patients. Publication bias may reduce the likelihood that negative trials will become part of the published literature. Statistically significant findings may represent benefits so small that they are not clinically important to patients. We have highlighted these considerations where relevant. Topical NSAIDs are strongly recommended for patients with knee OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. In keeping with the principle that medications with the least systemic exposure (i.e., local therapy) are preferable, topical NSAIDs should be considered prior to use of oral NSAIDs Topical capsaicin is conditionally recommended for patients with knee OA and conditionally recommended against in patients with hand OA. Topical capsaicin is conditionally recommended for treatment of knee OA due to small effect sizes and wide
