There are no published RCTs evaluating iontophoresis for OA in any anatomic location. Pulsed vibration therapy is conditionally recommended against in patients with knee OA. Few trials have addressed pulsed vibration therapy, and in the absence of adequate data, we conditionally recommend against its use. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA. Studies examining the use of TENS have been of low quality with small size and variable controls, making comparisons across trials difficult. Studies have demonstrated a lack of benefit for knee OA. Pharmacologic management (Table 2) RCTs of pharmacologic agents may be subject to a variety of limitations, including generalizability of their findings across
