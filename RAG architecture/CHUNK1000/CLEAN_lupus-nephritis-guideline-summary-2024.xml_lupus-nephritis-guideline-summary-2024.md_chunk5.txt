any LN class with an inadequate renal response (i.e., have not achieved at least a partial renal response by 6-12 months) we conditionally recommend escalation of treatment: • For initial DUAL therapy, escalate to TRIPLE therapy. • For initial TRIPLE therapy, change to an alternative TRIPLE therapy or consider addition of an anti-CD20 agent as a second immunosuppressive. In people with any LN class with refractory disease (i.e., failed two standard therapy courses), we conditionally recommend treatment escalation to a more intensive regimen, including addition of anti-CD20 agents, or combination therapy with three non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressives (i.e., MPAA, belimumab and CNI), or referral for investigational therapy.
