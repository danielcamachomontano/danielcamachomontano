to answer some of these questions. Another limitation of the guideline is that we grouped several separate populations for our PICO questions (e.g., knee OA, hip OA, hip ON with secondary arthritis, and knee ON with secondary arthritis) based on a clinical consensus from the orthopedic surgeons and the rheumatologists on the Core Team and lack of knowledge of the proportion of cases of ON with secondary arthritis that would be included in the literature review, with an understanding that subgroups might be created if evidence of differences in clinical outcomes was found by joint type (hip versus knee) and pathology (OA versus ON with secondary arthritis). No such evidence was found, and therefore, these were treated as a group despite the clear heterogeneity of the populations. Additional cost to the patient and cost effectiveness of nonoperative treatments were considered when the recommendations were made, but these were made based on a priori assumptions because there was a lack
