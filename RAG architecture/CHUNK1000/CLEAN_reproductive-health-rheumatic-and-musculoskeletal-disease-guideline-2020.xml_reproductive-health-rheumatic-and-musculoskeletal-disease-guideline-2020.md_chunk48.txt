serum, the risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects are not elevated We conditionally recommend treatment with CYC for life-threatening conditions in the second or third trimester When potentially teratogenic medications are discontinued prior to pregnancy, we strongly recommend a period of observation without medication or transition to pregnancy-compatible medications to ensure disease stability (as discussed above). In women with inadvertent exposure to teratogenic medications we strongly suggest immediate referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, pregnancy medication specialist, or genetics counselor as standard good practice. We strongly recommend HCQ, azathioprine/6mercaptopurine, colchicine, and sulfasalazine, medications commonly used for RMD, as compatible for use throughout pregnancy We conditionally recommend calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine) and NSAIDs as compatible for use during pregnancy We conditionally recommend discontinuation of NSAIDs
