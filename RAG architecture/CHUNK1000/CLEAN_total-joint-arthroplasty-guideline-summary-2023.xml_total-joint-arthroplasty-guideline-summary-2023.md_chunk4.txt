40 -49, we conditionally recommend proceeding to surgery without delay to achieve weight reduction to BMI < 40. Very low In our defined population with body mass index (BMI) 35 -39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to surgery without delay to achieve weight reduction to BMI < 35. Very low In our defined population with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA to improve glycemic control. Very low In our defined population with nicotine dependence, we conditionally recommend delaying arthroplasty for nicotine use reduction/cessation. Low In our defined population with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. There were no studies that either directly or indirectly answered our PICO question. In our defined population with a neuropathic joint, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA
