direct evidence supports use of oral HRT in aPL-negative women with SLE who have stable low-level disease activity and no contraindication to use aPL-positive patients. Estrogen use in aPL-positive patients should be avoided due to the potential increased risk of thrombosis. Data are limited, however, for many clinical situations, and specific recommendations vary in strength for this reason. In women with asymptomatic aPL, we conditionally recommend against treating with HRT. We strongly recommend against use of HRT in women with obstetric and/or thrombotic APS. We conditionally recommend against HRT use in patients with APS who are receiving anticoagulation treatment and in patients with APS who are currently negative for aPL. We conditionally recommend consideration of HRT, if desired, in women who have a history of positive aPL but are currently testing negative for aPL and have no history of clinical APS.  Risk of VTE may be increased with HRT use in the general population Direct
