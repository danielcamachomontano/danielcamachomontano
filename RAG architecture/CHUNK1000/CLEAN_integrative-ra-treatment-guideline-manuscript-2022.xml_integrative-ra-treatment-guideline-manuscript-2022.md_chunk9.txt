training) who can guide the specific design and intensity of the intervention. For patients with hand and/or wrist involvement and/or deformity, we conditionally recommend use of splinting, orthoses, and/or compression over no splinting, orthoses, and/or compression. For patients with foot and/or ankle involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping over no bracing, orthoses, and/or compression. For patients with knee involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing and/or orthoses over no bracing and/or orthoses. We conditionally recommend use of splinting, orthoses, and/or compression among individuals with hand/wrist involvement, use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping among individuals with foot/ankle involvement, and use of bracing and/or orthoses among individuals with knee involvement. These recommendations are based on very low certainty evidence to indicate that these approaches improve pain and physical function at the hand/wrist and
