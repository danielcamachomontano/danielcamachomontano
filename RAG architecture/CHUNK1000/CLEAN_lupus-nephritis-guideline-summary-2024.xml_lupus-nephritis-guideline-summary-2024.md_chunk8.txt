clinic visit but not more frequently than monthly. RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPIES: GPS: Decisions for initiation and type of dialysis and timing for kidney transplant require close collaboration with nephrology. In people with LN and ESKD, we strongly recommend kidney transplantation over dialysis. In people with LN who have progressive loss of kidney function and are nearing ESKD (eGFR of 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 ), we conditionally recommend preemptive kidney transplant over dialysis or non-preemptive transplant. In people with LN and ESKD, we conditionally recommend proceeding with kidney transplantation without requiring complete clinical or serologic remission, provided there is no other major organ involvement. In people with LN on current dialysis or after kidney transplantation, we strongly recommend regular follow up with rheumatology.
