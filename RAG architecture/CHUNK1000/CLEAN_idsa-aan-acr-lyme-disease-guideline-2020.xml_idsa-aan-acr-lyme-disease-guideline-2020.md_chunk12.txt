serum sample if the initial result is negative) rather than currently available direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture performed on blood or skin samples (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Comment: If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2-3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample. VI. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans? Recommendation: 1. For patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Comment: For patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin. VII. How long should a patient with erythema migrans be treated? Recommendation: 1. We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day
