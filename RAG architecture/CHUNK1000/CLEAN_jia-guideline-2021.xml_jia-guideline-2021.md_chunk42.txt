<h1>Table 7. Systemic JIA with inactive disease*</h1>

<p>|Recommendation|Certainty of evidence|PICO evidence report(s) basis|Page no(s).|
|---|---|---|---|
|Tapering and discontinuing glucocorticoids is strongly recommended after inactive disease has been attained.|Very low|PICO 28. In patients with systemic JIA with inactive disease treated with oral steroids, is taper to discontinuation of steroids superior to continuing long-term stable-dose steroids for preventing disease flare and minimizing side effects/medication toxicity?|139|
|Tapering and discontinuing biologic DMARDs is conditionally recommended after inactive disease has been attained.|Very low|PICO 29. In patients with systemic JIA in clinical remission with biologic monotherapy, is tapering by decreasing dosage superior to tapering dosing interval at preventing disease exacerbation, preventing development of antidrug antibodies, and minimizing medication toxicity?|140â€“143|</p>
