that ULT is indicated while the patient is experiencing a gout flare, starting ULT during the gout flare over starting ULT after the gout flare has resolved is conditionally recommended. Starting ULT during a flare has conceptual benefits, including the time efficiency offered by initiating therapy during the concurrent flare visit rather than risking the patient not returning for ULT initiation. Furthermore, input from the Patient Panel emphasized that patients are likely to be highly motivated to take ULT due to the symptoms related to the current flare. However, concerns about starting ULT during a flare include potential extension or worsening of a flare, as well as the possibility of information overload for patients, which may lead to conflating flare management and long-term ULT. Two small RCTs A treat-to-target management strategy that includes ULT dose titration and subsequent dosing guided by serial SU measurements to achieve a target SU, over a fixed-dose ULT strategy, is
