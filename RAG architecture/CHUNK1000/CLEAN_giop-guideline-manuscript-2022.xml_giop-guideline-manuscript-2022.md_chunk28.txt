|FRAX GC correction|If GC dose is &gt;7.5 mg/day, multiply the 10-year risk of MOF by 1.15 and the hip fracture risk by 1.2†|Not applicable as FRAX is not validated in this age group|
|Very high fracture risk|Prior OP fracture(s) OR BMD t-score ≤−3.5 OR FRAX (GC-Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% OR high GC ≥30 mg/day for &gt;30 days OR cumulative doses ≥5 g/y|Prior fracture(s) OR GC ≥30 mg/day OR cumulative ≥5 g/y|
