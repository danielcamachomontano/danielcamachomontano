or other ongoing medical comorbidities, apply to this recommendation as well. Patients who are recovering from another lower limb surgery (e.g., contralateral THA or TKA) may benefit from delaying TJA and using an ambulatory aid during the recovery period. However, delaying TJA for treatment with a brace or ambulatory aid can place a burden on the patient given the need for education on the proper use of ambulatory aids such as canes, as improper use may lead to altered gait mechanics, increased pain, and worsened function In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections.
