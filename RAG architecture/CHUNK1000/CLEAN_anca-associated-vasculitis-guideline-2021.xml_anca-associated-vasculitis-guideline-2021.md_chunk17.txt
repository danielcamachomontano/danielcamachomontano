sulfamethoxazole and glucocorticoids. Methotrexate is considered more effective than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for remission induction, based on previous findings Remission maintenance Recommendation: For patients with severe GPA/MPA whose disease has entered remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over methotrexate or azathioprine for remission maintenance. Rituximab is associated with a lower relapse rate than azathioprine when used for remission maintenance after remission induction with cyclophosphamide Different doses of rituximab have been used for remission maintenance, including IV 500 mg every 6 months  (FDA-approved), IV 1,000 mg every 4 months If methotrexate or azathioprine treatment is being considered for remission maintenance, the patient's clinical situation, preferences, and values should guide selection between them, given their comparable efficacy. Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA
