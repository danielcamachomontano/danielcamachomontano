lack of direct studies of relevance in OA. Tramadol is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or OA. Recent work has highlighted the very modest level of beneficial effects in the long-term (3 months to 1 year) management of non-cancer pain with opioids Non-tramadol opioids are conditionally recommended against in patients with knee, hand, and/or hip OA with the recognition that they may be used under certain circumstances, particularly when alternatives have been exhausted. As noted above, evidence suggests very modest benefits of long-term opioid therapy and a high risk of toxicity and dependence. Use of the lowest possible doses for the shortest possible length of time is prudent, particularly since a recent systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that less pain relief occurs during longer trials in the treatment of non-cancer chronic pain Colchicine is conditionally recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Two very small studies have
