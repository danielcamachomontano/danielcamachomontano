for RA management, based on low certainty evidence indicating that there is no improvement of pain and physical function specific to RA with these modalities. While some individuals with RA may receive benefit from these interventions (e.g., in the setting of comprehensive PT or OT), the Voting Panel recommended against electrotherapy because the evidence was not felt to outweigh the burden and costs. No recommendation was made by the Voting Panel on the use of vagus nerve stimulation, because this invasive procedure is not currently approved by the FDA as an intervention in RA. We conditionally recommend against use of chiropractic therapy. In the absence of evidence, we conditionally recommend against use of chiropractic therapy (i.e., chiropractic spinal adjustment) directly for the management of RA because of the potential cervical spine complications that can occur Tobacco cessation Due to existing clinical quality measures for tobacco use screening and cessation DISCUSSION This
