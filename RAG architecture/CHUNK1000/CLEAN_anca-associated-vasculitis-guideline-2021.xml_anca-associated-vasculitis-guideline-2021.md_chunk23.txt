For patients with GPA/MPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations and are not receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Rituximab is more effective than oral cyclophosphamide for reinduction of remission among patients who previously received cyclophosphamide and then experienced relapse, based on subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations while receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend switching from rituximab to cyclophosphamide over receiving additional rituximab for remission re-induction. Multiple factors can influence whether rituximab or cyclophosphamide treatment (IV or oral) is used, such as time since last rituximab infusion and cumulative cyclophosphamide dose. Cyclophosphamide is recommended if the patient
