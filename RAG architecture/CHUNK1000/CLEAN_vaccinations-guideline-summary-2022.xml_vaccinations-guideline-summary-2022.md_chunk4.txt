and the risk of a disease flare off immunosuppression is high. c for medications with more than one FDA-approved dosing interval, the longest interval should be chosen (e.g., hold subcutaneous adalimumab for 2 weeks although it can be dosed every 1 or every 2 weeks). d In children with autoinflammatory disorders or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in whom the risk of disease flare if biologic DMARDs are held is very high, shorter hold times can be considered if live-attenuated vaccination is critical. e the recommendation to hold IVIG prior to vaccination is designed to enhance vaccine efficacy, not safety.
