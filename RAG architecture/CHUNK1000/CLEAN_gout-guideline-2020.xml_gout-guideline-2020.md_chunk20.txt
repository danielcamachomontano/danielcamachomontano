a fixed, standard-dose ULT strategy. Moderate For all patients taking ULT, we strongly recommend continuing ULT to achieve and maintain an SU target of <6 mg/dl over no target. High For all patients taking ULT, we conditionally recommend delivery of an augmented protocol of ULT dose management by nonphysician providers to optimize the treat-to-target strategy that includes patient education, shared decision-making, and treat-to-target protocol. Certainty of evidence Allopurinol We conditionally recommend testing HLA-B*5801 prior to starting allopurinol for patients of Southeast Asian descent (e.g., Han Chinese, Korean, Thai) and African American patients, who have a higher prevalence of HLA-B*5801. 12 Very low We conditionally recommend against HLA-B*5801 testing in all others. For patients with a prior allergic response to allopurinol who cannot be treated with other oral ULT, we conditionally recommend using allopurinol desensitization. Very low Febuxostat For patients with gout
