year) randomized to receive febuxostat (versus placebo) were less likely to experience a subsequent flare (30% versus 41%; P < 0.05) Specific characteristics for patients with infrequent flares (e.g., SU concentration >9 mg/dl, CKD, CVD) that might influence the risk-benefit assessment were considered, but due to insufficient data for these subgroups, the Voting Panel did not find that these conditions warranted stronger ULT recommendations specific to these subgroups. Initiating ULT is conditionally recommended against in patients with gout experiencing their first gout flare. However, initiating ULT is conditionally recommended for patients with comorbid moderateto-severe CKD (stage â‰¥3), SU concentration >9 mg/ dl, or urolithiasis. While conditionally recommending against ULT initiation following the first gout flare in a patient with "uncomplicated" gout, the Voting Panel considered Patient Panel input and recognized that there may be patients who would prefer (or benefit from)
