activity. Medications noted above are known to have effects on SU concentrations Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to lowdose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication. Likewise, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against adding or switching cholesterollowering agents (e.g., statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid agents, etc.) to fenofibrate despite its urate-lowering effects 8 5 http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract DISCUSSION These guidelines reinforce the strategy of starting with lowdose ULT and titrating up to achieve the SU target. This strategy mitigates the risk of treatment-related adverse effects (e.g., hypersensitivity) as well as flare risk accompanying ULT initiation In contrast to the 2012 ACR Guidelines for the Management of Gout (which did not consider treatment costs), this document firmly
