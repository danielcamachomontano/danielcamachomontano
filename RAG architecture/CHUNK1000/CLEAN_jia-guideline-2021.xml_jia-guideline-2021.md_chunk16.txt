This recommendation is conditional, as bDMARDs may not always be immediately available, and glucocorticoids may help control systemic and joint manifestations until IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors can be started. Conventional synthetic DMARDs Conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended against as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS. This recommendation is strong despite limited evidence, as the Voting Panel noted multiple small studies of systemic JIA that documented lack of efficacy at controlling systemic features that are typically present at onset of disease, leading to a continued need for glucocorticoids Systemic JIA without MAS: subsequent therapy (Table 5 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are strongly recommended over a single or combination of csDMARDs for inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids for systemic JIA without MAS.
