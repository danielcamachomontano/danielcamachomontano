likelihood of benefit, but this recommendation was conditional on the specific contraindication. If the contraindication to TNFi use was the presence of congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease, secukinumab or ixekizumab was preferred, since these medications have not been shown to worsen these conditions. If the contraindication to TNFi use was tuberculosis, other chronic infection, or a high risk of recurrent infections, sulfasalazine was preferred over secukinumab, izekizumab, and tofacitinib. In these cases, efforts to mitigate the infections should be undertaken so that TNFi might safely be used. Treatment with rituximab, abatacept, ustekinumab, or IL-6 inhibitors is not recommended, even in patients with contraindications to TNFi, due to lack of effectiveness. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with a different TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to
