and other interventions have failed to achieve the SU target, and who continue to have frequent gout flares (≥2 flares/year) OR who have nonresolving subcutaneous tophi. Switching to pegloticase over continuing current ULT is strongly recommended against for patients with gout for whom XOI treatment, uricosurics, and other interventions have failed to achieve the SU target, but who have infrequent gout flares (<2 flares/year) AND no tophi. In clinical trials, patients with 3 or more self-reported gout flares during the previous 18 months, ≥1 tophi, and gouty arthropathy, defined clinically or radiographically as joint damage due to gout, were randomly assigned to pegloticase treatment. Patients additionally had contraindication to treatment with allo purinol or history of treatment failure to normalize uric acid despite ≥3 months of treatment with the maximum medically appropriate allopurinol dose (determined by the treating physician).
