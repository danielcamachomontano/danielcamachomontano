is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences. Patients who have neuropathic joints in the early stages of their disease may not have major pain or loss of function but may have severe joint destruction. As the disease progresses, patients develop pain, and the extent of bone loss and joint destruction worsens. These procedures are more technically challenging and often necessitate the use of more constrained implants typically reserved for revision arthroplasty. Proceeding with operative treatment in these cases is recommended because delaying surgery increases the technical difficulty of the procedure and does not improve outcomes after the procedure DISCUSSION This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the optimal timing of elective TJA in patients who have symptomatic moderate-to-severe OA or advanced symptomatic ON with secondary arthritis who have chosen to undergo surgical treatment after a shared-decision making process with their physician
