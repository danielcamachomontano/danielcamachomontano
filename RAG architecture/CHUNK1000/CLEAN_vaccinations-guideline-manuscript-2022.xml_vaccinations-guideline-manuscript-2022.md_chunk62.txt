| <strong>Whether to defer vaccination in patients with high disease activity to maximize vaccine immunogenicity and/or avoid worsening disease activity</strong> | <strong>Very low</strong>                                     | PICO 13. In patients with RMD, does the immunogenicity or efficacy of influenza vaccine differ in patients who have moderate to severely active underlying disease as compared to those in low disease activity or remission? | 737–739                  |
| For patients with RMD, giving non–live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended regardless of patients’ disease activity. | <strong>Very low</strong>                                     | PICO 18. Should moderately to severely ill patients with RMD with disease X defer vaccination (not live attenuated) until the disease is better controlled? | 930–931                  |
