and/or anti-La/ SSB antibodies and fetal first-or second-degree heart block shown on echocardiography, we conditionally recommend treatment with oral dexamethasone 4 mg daily. If CHB (without other cardiac inflammation) is present, we conditionally recommend against treating with dexamethasone. Fluorinated glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and betamethasone, cross the placenta; low-to-moderate-dose nonfluorinated glucocorticoids, such as prednisone and prednisolone, are largely metabolized before they reach the fetus. Whether dexamethasone given for fetal first-or second-degree heart block changes outcome is a matter of controversy. Treatment should be limited to several weeks, depending on response, because of the risk of irreversible fetal and maternal toxicity. Whether dexamethasone improves long-term survival for a fetus with CHB is controversial Medication use When the man's partner is pregnant, the concern is whether his medication is present in seminal fluid and can
