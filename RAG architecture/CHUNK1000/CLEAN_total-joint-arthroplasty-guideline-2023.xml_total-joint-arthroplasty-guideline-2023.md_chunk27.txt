would entail randomizing patients indicated for TJA to receive surgical treatment or delay for a trial of additional nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, intraarticular injections, or bracing, and then assessing long-term patient-important outcomes. Patients and surgeons may have concerns about participating in studies in which patients could be randomized to delayed surgery or not being offered resources for risk factor modification such as poor glycemic control. It may be difficult to complete studies with enough power to demonstrate the effectiveness of risk factor modification in part due to the relatively low rate of specific complications associated with TJA, even in high-risk patients. Nevertheless, future research is clearly needed in this distinct patient population. Quasi-experimental study designs may be more fit to answer some of these questions. Another limitation of the guideline is that we grouped several separate populations for our PICO questions (e.g.,
