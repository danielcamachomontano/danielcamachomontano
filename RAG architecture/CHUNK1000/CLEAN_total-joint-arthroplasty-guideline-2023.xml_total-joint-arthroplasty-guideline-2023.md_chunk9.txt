and very low quality. Prior to presenting to an orthopedic surgeon and being indicated for TJA, patients in the defined population have already attempted nonoperative treatment for an extended period. Further delay to TJA may lead to increased pain, loss of function, and worsening of medical comorbidities due to limited mobility. Patients may elect to delay surgery due to personal reasons (e.g., work or family obligations) or ongoing medical comorbidities that can be optimized prior to surgery. In these cases, patients may consider proceeding with nonoperative treatment (excluding intraarticular injections in some cases; see below) to provide pain relief while awaiting surgery. In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy. In patients who are indicated for TJA, mandated physical therapy is not recommended to delay or avoid surgery. While physical therapy may provide benefit in knee and
