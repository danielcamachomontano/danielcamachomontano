heterogeneity and lack of standardization in available preparations of stem cell injections, as well as techniques used. This treatment has not been evaluated in hand OA and, therefore, no recommendation is made with regard to OA of the hand. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and interleukin-1 receptor antagonists have been studied in trials using both subcutaneous and intraarticular routes of administration. Efficacy has not been demonstrated, including in erosive hand OA. Therefore, given their known risks of toxicity, we strongly recommended against their use for any form of OA. Initial observations addressing the use of anti-nerve growth factor (anti-NGF) agents suggest that significant analgesic benefits may occur but that incompletely explained important safety issues may arise. A small subset of patients treated with these agents
