reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation Certainty of evidence For patients starting any ULT, we strongly recommend allopurinol over all other ULT as the preferred first-line agent for all patients, including in those with CKD stage >3. Moderate We strongly recommend a xanthine oxidase inhibitor over probenecid for those with CKD stage >3. For allopurinol and febuxostat, we strongly recommend starting at a low dose with subsequent dose titration to target over starting at a higher dose (e.g., <100 mg/day [and lower in patients with CKD] for allopurinol or <40 mg/day for febuxostat). Moderate For probenecid, we conditionally recommend starting at a low dose (500 mg once or twice daily) with dose titration over starting at a higher dose. We strongly recommend initiating concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy (e.g., colchicine, NSAIDs, prednisone/prednisolone) over no antiinflammatory prophylaxis. The choice of specific antiinflammatory prophylaxis should be based
