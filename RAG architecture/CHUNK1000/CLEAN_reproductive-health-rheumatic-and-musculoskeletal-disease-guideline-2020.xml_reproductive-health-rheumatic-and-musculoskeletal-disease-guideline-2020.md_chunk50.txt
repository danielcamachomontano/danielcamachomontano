We strongly recommend tapering higher doses of nonfluorinated glucocorticoids to <20 mg daily of prednisone, adding a pregnancy-compatible glucocorticoid-sparing agent if necessary.

We conditionally recommend continuing tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy with infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, or golimumab prior to and during pregnancy Placental transfer and fetal exposure for most biologic therapies vary with gestational stage.
