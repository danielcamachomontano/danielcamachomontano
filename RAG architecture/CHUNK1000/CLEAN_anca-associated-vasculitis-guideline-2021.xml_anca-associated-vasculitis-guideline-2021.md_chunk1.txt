2021 American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation Guideline for the Management of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis  unknown      A7FDDF976624E2E85584FDD8C00804F0 10.1002/acr.24634  INTRODUCTION The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) comprise granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These diseases affect smalland medium-sized vessels and are characterized by multisystem organ involvement. GPA is characterized histologically by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3). Among European populations, prevalence ranges from 24 to 157 cases per million, with the highest prevalence reported in
