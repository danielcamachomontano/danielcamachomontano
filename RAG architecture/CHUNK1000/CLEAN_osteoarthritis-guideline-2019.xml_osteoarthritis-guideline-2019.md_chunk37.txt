This treatment has not been evaluated in hand OA and, therefore, no recommendation is made with regard to OA of the hand. Prolotherapy is conditionally recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA. A limited number of trials involving a small number of participants have shown small effect sizes of prolotherapy in knee or hip OA. However, injection schedules, injection sites, and comparators have varied substantially between trials. This treatment has not been evaluated in
