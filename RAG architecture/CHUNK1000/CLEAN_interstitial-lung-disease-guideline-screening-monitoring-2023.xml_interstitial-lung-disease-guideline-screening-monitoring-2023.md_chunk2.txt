those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM; including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and anti-synthetase syndrome), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and Sj√∂gren disease (SjD) are at particularly high risk. 1 There are no existing guidelines for ILD screening for people with SARDs. This guideline was developed to provide recommendations for the screening of ILD in people with SARDs (RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD) at greatest risk of ILD and for monitoring for ILD progression. These recommendations will facilitate rheumatologists' identification of people with SARDs who have ILD and assist in optimizing the co-management of people with SARDassociated ILD by rheumatologists and pulmonologists. METHODS This guideline was developed following the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures
