and not meant to be pursued at "any cost." Even strong recommendations require sound clinical judgment to balance the potential clinical benefits and harms (including costs) of medical decisions Gout flare management Using colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) as appropriate firstline therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is strongly recommended for patients experiencing a gout flare. Given similar efficacy and a lower risk of adverse effects, low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine is strongly recommended when colchicine is the chosen agent. † There is moderate certainty of evidence about the efficacy of the benefits, harms, and high certainty about the costs of pegloticase. For patients with high disease activity, the magnitude of potential benefits outweighs the harms and costs of the drug. ‡ For patients with minimal disease activity, the smaller potential benefits do not outweigh the
