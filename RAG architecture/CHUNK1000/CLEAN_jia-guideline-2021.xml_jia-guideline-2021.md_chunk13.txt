oral glucocorticoids are given to quickly alleviate severe symptoms prior to the onset of action of DMARDs, treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible Conventional synthetic DMARDs Conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended for inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or IAGCs for active TMJ arthritis. Methotrexate is conditionally recommended as a preferred agent over leflunomide. The TMJ is a high-risk joint due to major impact on activities of daily living, and thus, early use of csDMARD therapy is encouraged. The limited available evidence supports the use of methotrexate Biologic DMARDs Biologic DMARDs are conditionally recommended for inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or IAGCs and at least 1 csDMARD for active TMJ arthritis. There is no preferred bDMARD. Voting panelists deferred recommending a specific bDMARD because current studies of TMJ arthritis have been small and observational
