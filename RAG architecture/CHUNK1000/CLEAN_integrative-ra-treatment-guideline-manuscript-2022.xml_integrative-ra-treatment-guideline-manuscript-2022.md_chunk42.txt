<p>| <strong>Guiding principles for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis</strong> |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition that requires early diagnosis, evaluation, and management to achieve optimal outcomes. |
| Rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and follow a treat-to-target management strategy, as detailed in the 2021 ACR Rheumatoid Arthritis Pharmacologic Treatment Guidelines (1). |
| Individuals with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis seek many available therapies to maintain physical function, reduce pain, and improve their quality of life. |
| Treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis present with a variety of manifestations and experiences. |
