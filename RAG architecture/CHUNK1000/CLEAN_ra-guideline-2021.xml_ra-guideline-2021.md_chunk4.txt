of methotrexate despite very low-certainty evidence for hydroxychloroquine and low-certainty evidence for sulfasalazine based on the amount of data supporting the disease-modifying properties of methotrexate monotherapy compared to hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine and concerns over the long-term tolerability of sulfasalazine Methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity Despite low-certainty evidence of comparable efficacy, methotrexate is preferred over leflunomide because of the evidence supporting its value as an anchor DMARD in combination regimens. Additional advantages of methotrexate include its greater dosing flexibility and lower cost. Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity There is low-certainty evidence suggesting superiority of tocilizumab monotherapy Methotrexate monotherapy is
