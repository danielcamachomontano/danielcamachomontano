patients may benefit from continuing remission maintenance therapy for a longer duration Ungraded position statement: The duration of glucocorticoid therapy for GPA/MPA should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values. The optimal duration of glucocorticoid therapy for GPA/MPA is not well established. The immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids contributing to disease control should be balanced with the toxicities associated with its use. Overall, patients expressed a desire to minimize the glucocorticoid dose as much as possible but recognized that some patients may require low-dose glucocorticoids long-term to maintain disease quiescence. Screening for toxicities of glucocorticoid use (e.g., bone mineral density testing for osteoporosis) should be conducted. Treatment of disease relapse Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations and are not receiving rituximab for remission maintenance,
