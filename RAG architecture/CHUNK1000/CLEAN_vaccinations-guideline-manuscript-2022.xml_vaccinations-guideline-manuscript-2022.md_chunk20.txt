evidence can be found in Table 7 DISCUSSION This is the first guideline to address vaccination strategies across the entire adult and pediatric RMD spectrum. An underlying principle in this guideline is that patients should be vaccinated, and that missed vaccination opportunities should be avoided or minimized. This is particularly true regarding influenza vaccination, which is administered seasonally and is recommended for RMD patients even if their disease activity is high, they are taking high-dose glucocorticoids, and/or are taking rituximab. The Voting Panel generally favored simple recommendations to encourage vaccination and foster guideline adherence. There are few studies assessing the immunogenicity and safety of specific vaccines in relation to specific immunosuppressive medications, and there are virtually no studies assessing the impact of holding medications around the time of vaccination, particularly for vaccines other than for influenza. Therefore, many of the
