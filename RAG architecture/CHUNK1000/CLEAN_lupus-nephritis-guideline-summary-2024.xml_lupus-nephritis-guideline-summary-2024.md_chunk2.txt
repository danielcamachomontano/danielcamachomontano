impaired kidney function not otherwise explained, we conditionally recommend performing a kidney biopsy. For people with treated LN in remission who present with suspected LN flare (increased proteinuria, hematuria, and/or worsening kidney function), OR for people with â‰¥6 months of appropriate treatment and ongoing/worsening proteinuria, hematuria, and/or decreased kidney function, we conditionally recommend repeat kidney biopsy. TREATMENT OF ACTIVE LN (CLASS III/IV OR CLASS V): GPS: Prompt glucocorticoid treatment should be administered for suspected LN to suppress acute inflammation while awaiting a kidney biopsy and histopathology results. GPS: Dosage of LN medications should be adjusted in people with decreased GFR at initiation of therapy and periodically. GPS: Adjunctive treatment with systemic anticoagulation for people with LN and significant risk factors for thrombosis (e.g., low serum albumin in context of severe proteinuria) should be discussed with nephrology.
