desaturation testing in some rheumatology offices. Pulmonologists on the panel routinely perform ambulatory desaturation testing in their offices. It is difficult to recommend a specific interval of ambulatory desaturation testing, and there is no evidence to support this guidance. DISCUSSION This guideline provides recommendations to clinicians for ILD screening and monitoring in people with RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD. PFTs (including spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO) and HRCT chest are conditionally recommended for the screening of ILD in people with these SARDs, whereas PFTs, HRCT chest, and ambulatory desaturation testing are conditionally recommended for the monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. There are limited to no roles for chest radiography, 6MWD, bronchoscopy, or surgical lung biopsy for the routine screening or monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. We provide guidance on the risk factors and frequency of testing to evaluate for the development of ILD in people with SARDs.
