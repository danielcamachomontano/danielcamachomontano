For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and glucocorticoids) may be beneficial. We suggest collaborating with an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating GPA to determine whether these interventions should be used. Recommendation: For patients with GPA in remission who have nasal septal defects and/or nasal bridge collapse, we conditionally recommend reconstructive surgery, if desired by the patient. To optimize surgical outcomes, reconstructive surgery should be performed, after a period of sustained remission, by an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating GPA Recommendation: For patients with GPA and actively inflamed subglottic and/or endobronchial tissue with stenosis, we conditionally recommend treating with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical dilation with intralesional glucocorticoid injection alone. Subglottic or endobronchial stenoses should be managed by an otolaryngologist or
