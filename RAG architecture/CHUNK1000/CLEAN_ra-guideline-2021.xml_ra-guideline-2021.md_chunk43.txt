<li>PICO = population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes; Supp. App. 2 = Supplementary Appendix 2, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract; bDMARD = biologic DMARD; tsDMARD = targeted synthetic DMARD; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; csDMARD = conventional synthetic DMARD.</li>
</ul>

<p>†The closest matching PICO questions to each recommendation are provided.</p>

<p>‡ The first certainty of evidence applies to the first listed option; the second certainty of evidence applies to the second listed option.</p>

<p>§ The original PICO included individual DMARDs as comparators. The recommendation considers bDMARDs as a group.</p>

<p>¶ The direction of the beneficial effect is in favor of the nonpreferred option.</p>

<h1>Other recommendations for this patient population are the same as those for DMARD-naive patients.</h1>
