rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the choice of shortacting over long-acting preparations or the use of low rather than high doses. A recent report 2 Ultrasound guidance for intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is strongly recommended for injection into hip joints. When available, ultrasound guidance for steroid injection may help ensure accurate drug delivery into the joint, but is not required for knee and hand joints. However, imaging guidance for injection into hip joints is strongly recommended. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections versus other injections are conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. In OA generally, intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally recommended over other forms of intraarticular injection, including hyaluronic acid preparations. Head-to-head comparisons are few, but the evidence for efficacy of
