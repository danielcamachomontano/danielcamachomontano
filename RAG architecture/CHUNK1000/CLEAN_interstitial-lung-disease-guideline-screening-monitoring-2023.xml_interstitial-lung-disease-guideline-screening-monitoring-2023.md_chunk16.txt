a low sensitivity (64.0%) and moderate specificity (73.6%) of chest radiography relative to HRCT chest for identifying ILD among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with 6MWD. There was no evidence to support or oppose using 6MWD in the monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. 6MWD can be impacted by other health factors, such as arthritis and cardiac disease. Patients reported that 6MWD often did not reflect activities of daily living or function in daily life. If patients without confounding health factors can perform the test, it can be a useful marker to follow disease progression. 6MWD is important in the monitoring of patients pre-lung transplantation, those with pulmonary hypertension, and those unable to perform PFTs. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with bronchoscopy. There was no published evidence. The panel was not in favor of routine use of bronchoscopy for
