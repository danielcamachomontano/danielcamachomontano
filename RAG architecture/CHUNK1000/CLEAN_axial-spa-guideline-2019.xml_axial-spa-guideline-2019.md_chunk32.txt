ACR Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of axial SpA, but its role in monitoring patients is less well-defined. Spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, and especially in those for whom the findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease (as defined in Table 1 We used the GRADE method to develop these treatment recommendations in a way that was transparent, systematic, and explicit, and that was informed by the medical evidence as well as patient preferences. The major limitation of these guidelines is the very low quality of evidence for many recommendations, which necessitated reliance on the clinical expertise of the panel. For nonradiographic axial SpA, most recommendations were based on extrapolation of results from studies in AS. We tried to identify the most common and consequential treatment questions, so that the
