(CT), bone finite element analysis from CT scans, and BMD measurements from CT colonography. It would be helpful to have validated fracture prediction scores for patients aged <40 years. More studies are needed to better identify the patient populations that might benefit from combination therapy and sequential therapy in GIOP. Additional studies are required to determine the best treatment options and duration of therapy after discontinuation of DEN. In conclusion, GIOP remains a common and challenging clinical scenario that is frequently unrecognized and undertreated. By systematically synthesizing the current knowledge and available clinical trials, we have provided an updated guideline to help clinicians best care for patients requiring long-term GC use. 21514658, 2023, 12, Downloaded from https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240, Wiley Online Library on [13/12/2023].
