thus, may lead to the inappropriate prescription of supplemental oxygen. In such cases, ear or forehead probes offer potential for greater accuracy. Furthermore, although oxygen desaturation testing is routine practice for pulmonologists, implementation by rheumatologists may be challenging because of logistical considerations, highlighting one of many benefits of collaborative management between rheumatology and pulmonology for patients with SARD-ILD. It was clear that patients value and prefer collaboration and communication among their specialists. These guidelines are limited by the low certainty of evidence available for review. Most of the questions addressed were supported by small-scale observational studies. In some cases, the evidence was indirect, indicating that the populations and/or interventions investigated in the included studies deviated from those intended for specific questions. Additionally, we did not have any available evidence to examine the relationship
