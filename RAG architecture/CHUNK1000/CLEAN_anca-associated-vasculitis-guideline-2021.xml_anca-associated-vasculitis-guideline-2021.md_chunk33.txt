the experience with cyclophosphamide in other forms of vasculitis Recommendation: For patients with active, severe EGPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with cyclo phosphamide or rituximab over mepolizumab for remission induction. The efficacy of mepolizumab in severe EGPA has not been established, as patients with active, severe disease were excluded from the randomized trial Remission induction for active, nonsevere disease Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with mepolizumab and glucocorticoids over methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids. A range of immunosuppressive agents may be considered in the treatment of active, nonsevere EGPA, all of which are used with glucocorticoids. The clinical profile of nonsevere EGPA includes predominantly asthma, sinus disease, and nonsevere vasculitis. While there is significant clinical experience with methotrexate, azathioprine, and
