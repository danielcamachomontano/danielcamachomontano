in GIOP. We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN $& or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents. Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms with increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death We conditionally recommend treatment for those at moderate or very high risk of fracture with oral or IV BP $ , PTH/PTHrP % or DEN %&   We conditionally recommended against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death BP = bisphosphonate; PTH = parathyroid hormone; PTHrP = PTH-related
