In patients with GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend against dosing immunosuppressive therapy based on ANCA titer results alone. Increases in ANCA titers/levels are only modestly informative as an indicator of disease activity Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who are receiving rituximab or cyclophosphamide, we conditionally recommend prophy laxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia. Prophylaxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia is routinely used with cyclophosphamide treatment Very low Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend using the Five-Factor Score to guide therapy. Very low Ungraded position statement: In patients with sinonasal involvement in EGPA, treatment with nasal rinses and topical therapies (e.g., antibiotics, lubricants, and GCs) may be considered. Very low Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who are receiving cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally recommend prescribing medications for prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis
