very-low certainty evidence if the recommendation is considered benign, low cost, and without harms. A conditional recommendation is supported by lower certainty evidence, has uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or has costs expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations warrant shared decisionmaking with the patient. Notably, most evidence reviewed in this guideline is downgraded for indirectness because 1) identified studies in GIOP rely on a surrogate fracture risk marker, bone mineral density (BMD), because they were not powered for fracture outcomes and 2) available fracture data were exclusively or predominantly from general osteoporosis (OP) studies. Recommendations for fracture risk assessment (Figure 1 Key recommendations For all adults (≥18 years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months, we strongly recommended initial clinical fracture risk assessment including
