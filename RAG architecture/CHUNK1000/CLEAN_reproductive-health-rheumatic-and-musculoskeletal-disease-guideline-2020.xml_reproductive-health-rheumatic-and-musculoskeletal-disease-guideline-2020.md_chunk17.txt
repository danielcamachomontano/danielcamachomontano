or other complications of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). We strongly recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH in women with OB APS, and we strongly recommend therapeutic anticoagulation in women with thrombotic APS, during ART procedures. The strength of these recommendations rests on the severity of the risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis during ovarian stimulation. An added risk for thrombosis is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, an important, uncommon complication consisting of capillary leak syndrome (with pleural effusion and ascites) and, in severe cases, arterial and venous thrombosis and renal failure LMWH is used most commonly. Prophylactic dosing of enoxaparin is usually 40 mg daily, started at the beginning of ovarian stimulation, withheld 24-36 hours prior to oocyte retrieval, and resumed following retrieval. Optimal duration of prophylactic LMWH for asymptomatic aPL-positive patients undergoing ovarian
