|Consideration of risk factors for poor outcome (e.g., involvement of ankle, wrist, hip, sacroiliac joint, and/or TMJ, presence of erosive disease or enthesitis, delay in diagnosis, elevated levels of inflammation markers, symmetric disease) is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions.|Very low|PICO 9. In children with oligoarticular JIA, should poor prognostic features alter the treatment paradigm?|51â€“52|
|Use of validated disease activity measures is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions, especially to facilitate treat-to-target approaches.|Very low|PICO 10. In children with oligoarticular JIA, should disease activity measures alter the treatment paradigm?|52|</p>
