For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and GCs) may be beneficial. 36, 37, 38, 39 Very low to low Recommendation: For patients with GPA in remission who have nasal septal defects and/or nasal bridge collapse, we conditionally recommend reconstructive surgery, if desired by the patient. Low Recommendation: For patients with GPA and actively inflamed subglottic and/or endobronchial tissue with stenosis, we conditionally recommend treating with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical dilation with intralesional GC injection alone. Low Recommendation: For patients with GPA and mass lesions (e.g., orbital pseudotumor or masses of the parotid glands, brain, or lungs), we conditionally recommend treatment with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical removal of the mass lesion with immunosuppressive therapy. 41, 42 Very low to low Other considerations Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA, we conditionally
