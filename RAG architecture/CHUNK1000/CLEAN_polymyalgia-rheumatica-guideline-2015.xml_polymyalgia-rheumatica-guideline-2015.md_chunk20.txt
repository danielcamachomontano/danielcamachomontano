The efficacy of MTX was addressed in four randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study testing the use of MTX plus oral GCs (initial prednisone doses ranging from 15 to 25 mg/day) The reasons why the panel did not support a stronger recommendation for the use of MTX in PMR are the following: 1) the total number of patients investigated in randomized trials was small (n5194) The group recognized that no recommendation can be made for the use of other non-biologic (ie, conventional synthetic and conventional targeted) DMARDs in PMR because of the lack of good evidence from PMR studies.
