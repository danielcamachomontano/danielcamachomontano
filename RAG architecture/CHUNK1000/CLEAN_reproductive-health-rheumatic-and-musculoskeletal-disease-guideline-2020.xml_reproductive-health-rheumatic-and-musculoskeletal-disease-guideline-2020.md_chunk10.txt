combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives is 36 times higher than the baseline annual risk of 1/10,000 women The copper IUD is a highly effective alternative that does not increase risk of VTE, but it may increase menstrual bleeding and cramping for several months after insertion. Progestin IUDs may decrease these symptoms We suggest the progestin-only pill (which is an effective, but not highly effective, contraceptive) as a low-risk alternative for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an IUD. The lack of data specific to aPL-positive patients using the progestin-only pill or IUD must be weighed against the risk of pregnancy-related VTE in the general population, which is >10 times that seen with estrogen-progestin contraceptive use. Pregnancy-related thrombosis risk in aPL-positive patients is not well quantified, but VTE risk is 197/10,000 women-years for pregnant patients with a single prothrombotic mutation and 776/10,000 women-years Other special RMD situations.
