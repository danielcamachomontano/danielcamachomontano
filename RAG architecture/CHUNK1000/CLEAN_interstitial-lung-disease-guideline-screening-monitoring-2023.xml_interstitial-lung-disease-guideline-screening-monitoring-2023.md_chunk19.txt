more frequent monitoring (3-6 months). SjD-ILD tends to be milder than other types of SARD-associated ILD; however, those with the Ro52 antibody can progress quickly. SjD can occur as an overlap condition with anti-synthetase syndrome, SSc, and RA. More frequent monitoring, based on physician judgment, should be performed in patients with symptom worsening, a UIP pattern, presence of autoantibodies associated with rapidly progressive disease (eg, anti-MDA-5), and worsening PFTs. People with MCTD and prominent features of SSc or IIM may benefit from more frequent monitoring. For people with SARD-ILD, we do not provide guidance about frequency of routine HRCT chest for monitoring ILD but suggest HRCT chest when clinically indicated. There was hesitancy to recommend how frequently HRCT chest should be performed. HRCT chest is a complementary test to PFTs for the monitoring of ILD progression and may be specifically useful in cases in which coughing or other factors might affect PFT
