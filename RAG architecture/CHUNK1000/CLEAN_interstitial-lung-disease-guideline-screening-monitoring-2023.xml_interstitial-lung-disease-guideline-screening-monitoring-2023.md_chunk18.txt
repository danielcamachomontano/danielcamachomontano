year, then less frequently once stable. More frequent monitoring is needed early in the course of disease and in patients with active or progressive disease, and then every 6 to 12 months after the first year if the disease is stable. For people with long-standing SSc or IIM and prolonged stability of their ILD, we suggest less frequent monitoring. This range allows for flexibility. For people with RA-ILD, SjD-ILD, and MCTD-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3 to 12 months for the first year, then less frequently once stable. RA-ILD typically progresses more slowly than the other SARDs; however, a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern confers a worse prognosis and may warrant more frequent monitoring. Monitoring those with RA-ILD with PFTs every 6 to 12 months is suggested, recognizing that specific situations may warrant more frequent monitoring (3-6 months). SjD-ILD tends to be milder than other types of SARD-associated ILD; however, those with the Ro52 antibody can
