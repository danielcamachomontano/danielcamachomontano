activity assessment and imaging In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using the treat-to-target strategy, which aims at a target of an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score <1.3 (or 2.1), over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment (new, PICO 67). The concept of treat-to-target strategies is well-founded in chronic disease management for conditions that have an accurate measure of disease activity (often one that is asymptomatic, as in blood pressure or glycosylated hemoglobin), a tight link between this disease activity measure and future health outcomes, and evidence that maintaining a particular target in the disease activity measure is closely associated with better long-term health In adults with AS of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68). In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we
