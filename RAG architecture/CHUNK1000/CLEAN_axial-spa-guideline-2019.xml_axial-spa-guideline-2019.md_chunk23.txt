spondyloarthritis Parallel questions on pharmacologic treatment were investigated for patients with nonradiographic axial SpA. There were no relevant published data for 19 questions. There was high-quality evidence only for the use of TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, which was examined in several clinical trials. Low-quality or very low-quality evidence from single studies suggested no differences in outcomes among different TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, high likelihood of relapse following discontinuation of TNFi, and no association between co-treatment with nonbiologics and TNFi persistence (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract | 1609 Therefore, the recommendations for nonradiographic axial SpA were largely extrapolated from evidence in AS (Table 3 E. Disease activity assessment and imaging In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using the treat-to-target strategy, which aims at a
