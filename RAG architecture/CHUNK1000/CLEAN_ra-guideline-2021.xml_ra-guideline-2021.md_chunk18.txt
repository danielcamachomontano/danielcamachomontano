if they obtain relief from IA injection(s). Recommendations for tapering/discontinuing DMARDs (Table 5) Because of the moderate-to-high risk for flare and the potential for irreversible long-term damage associated with stopping all DMARDs, the following recommendations presume that patients maintain a therapeutic dose of at least 1 DMARD. In addition, the recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering. Patients in remission for <6 months should not routinely be considered for dose reduction or withdrawal. Although the optimal time at target prior to tapering has not been established, the voting panel considered 6 months to be a reasonable minimal length of time to ensure stable disease control. "Dose reduction" refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. "Gradual discontinuation" denotes gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.
