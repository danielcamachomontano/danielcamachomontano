"uncomplicated" gout, the Voting Panel considered Patient Panel input and recognized that there may be patients who would prefer (or benefit from) ULT, underscoring the need for shared decision-making. As noted above, data from the RCT of patients with â‰¤2 previous flares (and no more than 1 gout flare in the preceding year) supported the benefit of ULT for reduction of SU concentration and gout flare risk Certainty of evidence For patients with 1 or more subcutaneous tophi, we strongly recommend initiating ULT over no ULT. 1 High For patients with radiographic damage (any modality) attributable to gout, we strongly recommend initiating ULT over no ULT. Moderate For patients with frequent gout flares (>2/year), we strongly recommend initiating ULT over no ULT. 3 High For patients who have previously experienced >1 flare but have infrequent flares (<2/year), we conditionally recommend initiating ULT over no ULT. Moderate For patients experiencing their first flare, we conditionally
