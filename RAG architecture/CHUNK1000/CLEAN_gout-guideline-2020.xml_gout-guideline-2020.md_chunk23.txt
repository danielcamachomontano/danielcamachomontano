A single observational study demonstrated that higher levels of 24-hour urinary uric acid and higher levels of undissociated urinary uric acid were associated with urolithiasis We found no evidence to support a recommendation of checking urinary uric acid level for patients receiving uricosuric treatment or for alkalinizing the urine. The Voting Panel supported standard best practice that patients with known renal calculi or moderate-to-severe CKD (stage >3) should not be treated with uricosurics.
