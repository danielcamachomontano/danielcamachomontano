subspecialists may favor a different management strategy. We encourage rheumatologists to discuss treatment plans and coordinate care with other subspecialists as needed. Recently, a clinical trial of avacopan in patients with GPA and MPA was published This guideline highlights gaps in our knowledge for the treatment of AAV. Most glaring is the lack of biomarker assessments or other noninvasive diagnostic testing with minimal toxicity that can accurately assess disease activity and predict outcomes. In addition, while we have evidence from randomized clinical trials to support recommendations regarding initial remission induction and maintenance therapy, critical questions remain unanswered, such as the optimal duration of therapy. These gaps in knowledge reinforce the need for ongoing research in these diseases. Specific areas to investigate include the following: 1) biomarker studies to identify more specific, reliable indicators of disease activity that can guide treatment
