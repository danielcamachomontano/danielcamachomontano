whose disease has entered remission, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate or azathioprine over trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for remission maintenance. The Voting Panel strongly favored the use of methotrexate or azathioprine over trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but this recommendation is conditional due to the lack of sufficient high-quality evidence comparing the 2 treatments. Recommendation: In patients with GPA whose disease has entered remission, we conditionally recommend against adding trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to other therapies (e.g., rituximab, azathioprine, methotrexate, etc.) for the purpose of remission maintenance. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may have benefit for patients with sinonasal involvement Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA receiving remission maintenance therapy with rituximab who have hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g., IgG <3 gm/liter) and recurrent severe infections, we conditionally recommend immunoglobulin supplementation.
