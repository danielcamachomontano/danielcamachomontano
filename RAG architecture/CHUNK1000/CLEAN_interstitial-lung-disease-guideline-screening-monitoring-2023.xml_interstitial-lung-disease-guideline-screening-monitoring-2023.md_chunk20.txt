test to PFTs for the monitoring of ILD progression and may be specifically useful in cases in which coughing or other factors might affect PFT performance or interpretation, when changes in symptoms or PFT results lead to uncertainty about whether there has been ILD progression, when there is concern for infection or malignancy, or when assessing treatment response. For people with SARD-ILD, we suggest monitoring for ambulatory desaturation every 3 to 12 months. There was a discrepancy between the application of this clinical assessment by rheumatologists and pulmonologists. Testing for ambulatory desaturation is inexpensive and informs a patient's need for supplemental oxygen. However, evaluation of ambulatory desaturation is not routine practice for many rheumatologists, and there may be operational challenges in performing ambulatory desaturation testing in some rheumatology offices. Pulmonologists on the panel routinely perform ambulatory desaturation testing in their offices. It
