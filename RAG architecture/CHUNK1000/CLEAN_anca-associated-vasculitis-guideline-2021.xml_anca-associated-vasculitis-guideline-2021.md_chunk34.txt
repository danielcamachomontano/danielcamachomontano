predominantly asthma, sinus disease, and nonsevere vasculitis. While there is significant clinical experience with methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, there are limited data regarding their efficacy, and these treatments have not been assessed in randomized clinical trials. The GRADE methodology used in the guideline development process weights clinical trials more heavily than observational studies. Thus, mepolizumab is recommended as the first choice, because it has been found to be efficacious for nonsevere EGPA in a randomized trial Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over glucocorticoids alone. Patients should be treated with adjunctive methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil rather than glucocorticoids alone in order to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. One randomized trial that combined patients with
