inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine) and NSAIDs as compatible for use during pregnancy We conditionally recommend discontinuation of NSAIDs pre-conception if the patient is having difficulty conceiving (and if disease control would not be compromised), due to the possibility of NSAID-induced unruptured follicle syndrome, a cause of subfertility We strongly recommend against use of NSAIDs in the third trimester because of the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus We conditionally recommend nonselective NSAIDs over cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitors in the first 2 trimesters, due to lack of data on cyclooxygenase 2-specific inhibitors. Nonfluorinated glucocorticoids should be used when needed, but substitution of steroid-sparing pregnancy-compatible immunosuppressive therapy is desirable when high-dose or prolonged use is required. We conditionally recommend continuing low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (â‰¤10 mg daily of prednisone or nonfluorinated equivalent) during
