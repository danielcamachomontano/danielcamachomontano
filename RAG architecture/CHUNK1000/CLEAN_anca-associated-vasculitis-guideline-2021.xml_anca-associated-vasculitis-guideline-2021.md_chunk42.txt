and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over adding omalizumab. The published evidence on omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, in EGPA has been limited. Therefore, even for a patient with high serum IgE levels, mepolizumab is the preferred choice based on evidence from the randomized controlled trial Other considerations Recommendation: For patients with newly diagnosed EGPA receiving leukotriene inhibitors, we conditionally recommend continuing leukotriene inhibitors over discontinuing them. Following the introduction of leukotriene inhibitors, concerns were raised about a link with the development of EGPA. In subsequent retrospective studies, it was not concluded that there is a causal relationship between leukotriene inhibitors and EGPA Ungraded position statement: Use of leukotriene inhibitors is not contraindicated for patients with EGPA with active asthma and/or sinonasal disease.
