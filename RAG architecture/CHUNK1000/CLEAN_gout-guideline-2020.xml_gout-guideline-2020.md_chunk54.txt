|For patients experiencing a gout flare, we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH (the choice of colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids should be made based on patient factors and preferences).|32|High†|
|When colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects.| | |
|For patients experiencing a gout flare for whom other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment).|33|Moderate|
|For patients who may receive NPO, we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH.|32|High†|
