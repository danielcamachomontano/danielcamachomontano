high-dose GC therapy (>0.1 mg/kg/day), BP therapy is warranted. For adults ≥40 years, the panel voted to give clinicians the ability to select an OP therapy based on the patient's specific comorbidities and preferences, BMD values, fracture history, and other characteristics, rather than rank ordering the medication recommendations. Fracture prevention data in GIOP is currently limited to oral BP and PTH. Anabolic agents may be the preferred initial therapy for those at very high risk for fracture based on BMD and vertebral fracture prevention superiority compared to anti-resorptives in patients with very high risk postmenopausal OP. Of note, abaloparatide and ROM are not approved in GIOP, and we recognize it may be difficult to access these medications for GIOP. The panel specifically noted that the potential harms of RAL (venous thromboembolism [VTE] and fatal stroke) and ROM (major myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) would often favor the other available options when
