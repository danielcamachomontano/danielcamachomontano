addition of sulfasalazine could be considered in the rare patient whose axial symptoms are well-controlled with TNFi but who has active peripheral arthritis. In adults with either active or stable AS on treatment with TNFi, we conditionally recommend against co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate (new, PICO 64). In rheumatoid arthritis, the likelihood of TNFi discontinuation is lower among patients who receive co-treatment with methotrexate, perhaps by reducing the development of antidrug antibodies http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract B. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with stable AS In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend on-demand treatment with NSAIDs over continuous treatment with NSAIDs (PICO 1). This recommendation applies to patients whose AS has been stable while not receiving any pharmacologic treatment. In this group, the panel considered that the potential toxicities of continuous NSAID treatment outweighed the
