In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score  of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-tosevere disease as a body surface area of ≥5% meeting to ensure that patient input was incorporated into the final PsA guideline. Examples of patient feedback included strong value on
