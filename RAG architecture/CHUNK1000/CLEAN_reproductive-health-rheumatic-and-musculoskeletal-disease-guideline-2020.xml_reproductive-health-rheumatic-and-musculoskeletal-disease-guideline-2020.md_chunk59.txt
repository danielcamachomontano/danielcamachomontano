Because women with RMD who plan to conceive, are pregnant, or are lactating are usually excluded from clinical trials, large-scale data about medication use in these populations are also lacking. Pregnancy registries collect these data but suffer reporting bias and may not reflect the racial and ethnic make-up of the patient population.

With the development of this guideline, the ACR recognizes the key role of clinical rheumatologists not only in managing disease activity but also in understanding the interactions of RMDs and their therapies in the context of reproductive health. The most important goal of this guideline is to provide substance and
