and osteoporosis. A treat-to-target approach is conditionally recommended over usual care for patients who have had an inadequate response to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs The recommendation is conditional because of the uncertain incremental benefits of treat-to-target over usual care in this patient population. In this context, usual care refers to commonly employed practice patterns, i.e., adjustment of treatment based on shared decision-making, albeit typically without systematic monitoring of disease activity using validated measures to reach a predefined target. Moreover, 1) the number of remaining available treatment options, 2) the impact of noninflammatory causes of pain, comorbidities, and/or damage on the accuracy of validated disease activity assessments, and 3) the patient's threshold for changing medications may have a more significant influence on the decision to follow a treat-to-target approach in this population compared to patients who are bDMARD-and tsDMARD-naive.
