In these patients, delaying TJA may lead to increased instability and increased juxtaarticular bone loss or deformity, which may increase the technical difficulty of the procedure as well as increase the risk of failure and need for revision. Although patients who have severe bone loss, deformity, or instability have an increased risk of revision or reoperation, this risk will likely only increase over time, with further delay in surgery. Thus, timely TJA should be performed in these cases when medically appropriate. This recommendation is conditional because of the very low quality of evidence. In our defined population with a neuropathic joint, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. There was no evidence for this recommendation; thus the recommendation is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences. Patients who have neuropathic joints in the early stages of their disease may not have
