<p>|Recommendations|Level of evidence (evidence [refs.] reviewed)†|
|---|---|
|In adult patients with active PsA and diabetes who are both OSM- and biologic treatment–naive,| |
|1. Start an OSM other than MTX over a TNFi biologic (PICO 63a)|Very low (118, 119)|
|Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider starting a TNFi, if the patient has severe PsA§ or severe/active skin disease,¶ when diabetes is well controlled.| |
|In adult patients with active PsA and frequent serious infections who are both OSM- and biologic treatment–naive,| |
|2. Start an OSM over a TNFi biologic (PICO 64)|Moderate (33, 120)|
|Strong recommendation supported by moderate-quality evidence, including a black box warning against the use of a TNFi biologic with regard to increased risk of serious infection.| |
|3. Start an IL-12/23i biologic over a TNFi biologic (PICO 65)|Very low (33)|
