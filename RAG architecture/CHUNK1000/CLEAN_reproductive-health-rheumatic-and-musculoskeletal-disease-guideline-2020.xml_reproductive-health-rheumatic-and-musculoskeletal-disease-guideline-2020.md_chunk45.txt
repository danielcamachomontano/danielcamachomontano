or drug-specific data. We strongly recommend against use of CYC and thalidomide in men prior to attempting conception. Paternal use of CYC may impair spermatogenesis or be mutagenic for DNA In men with RMD who are planning to father a pregnancy, we strongly recommend continuation of HCQ, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, colchicine, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors In men with RMD who are planning to father a pregnancy, we conditionally recommend, based on a smaller body of evidence, continuing treatment with MTX, MMF, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, calcineurin inhibitors, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Although the drug label suggests discontinuation of MTX before attempting pregnancy, data show no evidence for mutagenesis or teratogenicity Although sulfasalazine may affect sperm count and quality, there are no data suggesting teratogenicity We conditionally recommend continuation of anakinra and rituximab based on limited data Maternal medication use.
