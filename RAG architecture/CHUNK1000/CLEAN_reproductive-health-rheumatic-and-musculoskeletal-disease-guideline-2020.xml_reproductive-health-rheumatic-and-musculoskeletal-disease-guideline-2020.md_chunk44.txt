In fact, post-conception exposure of the embryo or fetus is likely minimal,  as seminal concentrations of medications and volumes transferred are small In the absence of adequate data regarding paternal exposure for most medications used for RMD, we developed recommendation statements when 1) at least some data on paternal exposure were available, 2) accumulated clinical experience of paternal exposure could guide the recommendation, or 3) there were no data on paternal exposure, but maternal exposure demonstrates teratogenicity.
