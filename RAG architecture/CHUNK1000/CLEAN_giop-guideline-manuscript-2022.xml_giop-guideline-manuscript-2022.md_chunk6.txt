we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms with increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death. We conditionally recommended against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death (eg, age at diagnosis, growth, body mass index [BMI], disease severity, GC dosing, BMD, symptomatic or asymptomatic vertebral compression fractures) should be taken into account when considering assessment for OP therapy * As in prior guidelines, we used risk categories of low, moderate, and high using DXA and/or FRAX assessments (see Table 1 2 For adults continuing chronic GC â‰¥2.5 mg/day but <7.5 mg/day and assessed as low fracture risk, who were not recommended to start therapy, or moderate fracture risk who chose not to start OP therapy (except calcium and vitamin D), we strongly recommend fracture risk reassessment every 1 to 2 years (PICO 9.1-9.4).
