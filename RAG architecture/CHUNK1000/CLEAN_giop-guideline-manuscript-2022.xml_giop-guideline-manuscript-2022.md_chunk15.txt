Patients with GFR <30 mL/min might require biologically active VitD to maintain neutral calcium balance. For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years treated with GCs for >3 months who are at low or moderate risk for fracture, optimization of age-appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D to fulfill the Recommended Daily Allowance is conditionally recommended in addition to an exercise program. We conditionally recommend against starting OP therapy due to the low risk of osteoporotic fractures in children and youth ages 4 to 17 years (PICO 7.1a-7.5a).
