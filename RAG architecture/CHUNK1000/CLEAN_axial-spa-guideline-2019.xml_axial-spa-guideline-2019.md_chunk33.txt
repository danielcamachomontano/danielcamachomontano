were based on extrapolation of results from studies in AS. We tried to identify the most common and consequential treatment questions, so that the recommendations would be useful in guiding clinical decision-making. The low quality of evidence for many questions is an indication that research has not yet tackled many of the most important treatment questions. As more treatment options become available, this problem will grow. Importantly, failure to recommend a particular medication does not imply that it is contraindicated. Key evidence gaps include the comparative effectiveness and safety of different biologics, the optimal sequencing of treatments, and the role of NSAIDs. This update addressed only a subset of treatment questions. The 2015 recommendations that were not reexamined are to be considered extant. Recommendations are meant to describe the approach to treatment of the typical patient and cannot anticipate all possible clinical scenarios. Application of these
