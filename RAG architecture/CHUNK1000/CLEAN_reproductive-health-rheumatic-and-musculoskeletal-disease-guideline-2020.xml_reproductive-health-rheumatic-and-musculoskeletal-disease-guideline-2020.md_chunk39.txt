data support the use of intravenous immunoglobulin. We strongly recommend against adding prednisone to prophylactic-dose heparin or LMWH and low-dose aspirin in patients in whom standard therapy has been unsuccessful, since there are no controlled studies demonstrating a benefit. We acknowledge, however, that this recommendation is based on a lack of compelling data rather than data showing no clear benefit, and also that potential risk with this therapy is likely to be strongly affected by daily dosage, with higher doses imparting greater risk of side effects. We conditionally recommend the addition of HCQ to prophylactic-dose heparin or LMWH and low-dose aspirin therapy for patients with primary APS. Recent small studies of APS pregnancies suggest that HCQ may decrease complications In pregnant women with positive aPL who do not meet criteria for APS and do not have another indication for the drug (such as SLE), we conditionally recommend against treating with prophylactic HCQ.
