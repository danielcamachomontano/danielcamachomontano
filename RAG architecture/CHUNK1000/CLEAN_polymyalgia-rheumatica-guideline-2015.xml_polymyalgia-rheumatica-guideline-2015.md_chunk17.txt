The panel did not specify a clinical phenotype where i.m. GCs would be appropriate or adequate therapy; however, the panel agreed that in clinical practice this preparation may be considered in cases where a lower cumulative GC dose is desirable, for example in female patients with difficult to control hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and/or glaucoma The reasons why the panel did not endorse a strong recommendation for the use of i.m. methylprednisolone are the following: 1) the efficacy of i.m. methylprednisolone is supported by a single randomized controlled trial and confirmation of these data is still necessary Recommendation 6: (PICO 8) The panel conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs for the treatment of PMR, except for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs below the low-dose range (prednisone or equivalent ,5 mg daily). There are no studies available addressing this issue specifically in PMR. Based on
