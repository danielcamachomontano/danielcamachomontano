secukinumab, ixekizumab.** High-quality evidence Studies that provide high confidence in the effect estimate, and new data from future studies are thought unlikely to change the effect. Moderate-quality evidence Studies that provide confidence that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate but could be substantially different. Low-quality evidence Studies that provide limited confidence about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate. Very low-quality evidence Studies that provide very little certainty about the effect, and the true effect may be quite different from the estimate. Strong recommendation Action should be favored in almost all patients, usually requiring high-quality evidence, high confidence that future research will not alter the conclusion, AND an assessment that the desirable effects of the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Should not be taken to imply that the intervention has large clinical benefits.
