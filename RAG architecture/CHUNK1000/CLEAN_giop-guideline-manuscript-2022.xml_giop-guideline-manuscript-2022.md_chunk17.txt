continuing GC treatment who have had an osteoporotic fracture â‰¥12 months after starting OP therapy, or who have had a significant loss of BMD (eg, greater than the least significant change per their DXA machine) after 1 to 2 years of OP treatment, we conditionally recommend changing to another class of OP medication over not switching the class of OP medication (PICO 10.1-10.9). If oral BP is the first OP therapy and suboptimal adherence or poor absorption is suspected, based on low certainty evidence, we conditionally recommend treatment with IV BP, DEN, ROM, or PTH/PTHrP. Of note, use of PTH/PTHrP after long-term BP treatment has blunted anabolic response but still increases BMD. If DEN is the first agent, switching to PTH/PTHrP may lead to transient bone losses in the hip and spine and is not recommended 4 Recommendations for treatment when GC are discontinued (Figure 5 For adults taking OP therapy and discontinuing GC therapy, with no new fragility fracture and a current BMD
