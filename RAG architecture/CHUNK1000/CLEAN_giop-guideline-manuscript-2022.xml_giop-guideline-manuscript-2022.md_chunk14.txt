based on individual patient factors over no treatment (PICO 5. In this solid organ transplant population, we conditionally recommend against using ROM due to potential harms in this population (PICO 5.9, 5.21, 5.16). This group of patients is typically considered at increased risk of fracture regardless of BMD, due to the known risk of OP associated with solid organ transplantation and anti-rejection medications. The overall certainty of evidence for treatment in this population is low, and numerous potentially influential individual patient factors need to be weighed when selecting treatment. For adult renal transplant recipients on chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend metabolic bone disease expert evaluation for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). In patients with stage IV and V CKD, renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is nearly universal The panel
