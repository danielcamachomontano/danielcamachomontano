desaturation testing as a screening test for ILD in SARDs. Given feasibility concerns in rheumatology outpatient practices, routine ambulatory desaturation testing was not recommended as a screening test. Within pulmonary outpatient practices and/or interdisciplinary models of shared care, ambulatory desaturation testing is more feasible and can be more easily offered in selected patients such as those with inadequate PFT quality, those who are unable to perform PFTs, or those with associated pulmonary hypertension. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy. Based on very low-certainty evidence from two observational studies, One retrospective observational (very low-certainty evidence) study provided indirect evidence for this recommendation. Suggestions for frequency of screening Evidence to support the frequency of testing was limited, The Core Team and Voting Panel preferred a risk-based approach. We
