2022 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis      E6CF781F3D07C386647CEFDED26B8578  A strong recommendation was made to use oral bisphosphonates (BPs) over no treatment for adults â‰¥40 years receiving long-term GCs, at high and very high risk for fracture, based on available fracture data in GIOP populations. Other agents including intravenous BPs, PTH/PTHrP, and denosumab (DEN) are also options and are conditionally recommended given lack of fracture prevention data in GIOP populations. For adults at high risk, we conditionally recommended DEN or PTH/PTHrP over BP. For adults at very high risk, we conditionally recommended PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP. We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN $& or
