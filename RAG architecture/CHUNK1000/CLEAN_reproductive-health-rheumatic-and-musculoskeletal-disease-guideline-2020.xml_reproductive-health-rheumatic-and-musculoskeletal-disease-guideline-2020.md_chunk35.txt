protein:creatinine ratio, or anti-DNA, C3, or C4 levels may indicate possible SLE flare and/or preeclampsia despite absence of clinical symptoms. Frequency of laboratory monitoring and rheumatology followup may vary with an individual patient's clinical status and medications. Antiphospholipid antibody is a major risk factor for pregnancy loss and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in SLE patients Antiphospholipid antibody Antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients without thrombosis or obstetric complications. Asymptomatic aPL-positive patients (those without pregnancy complications or history of thrombosis) are not generally treated with prophylactic therapy to prevent pregnancy loss.

In pregnant women with positive aPL who do not meet criteria for obstetric or thrombotic APS, we conditionally recommend treating with prophylactic aspirin, 81 or 100 mg
