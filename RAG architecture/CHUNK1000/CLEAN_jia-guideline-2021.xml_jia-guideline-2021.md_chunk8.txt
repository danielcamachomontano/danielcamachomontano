altogether. Glucocorticoids Intraarticular glucocorticoids (IAGCs) are strongly recommended as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis. Triamcinolone hexacetonide is strongly recommended as the preferred agent. Although the evidence is of low quality, IAGCs are strongly recommended due to low potential of adverse effects and high likelihood of sustained response Oral glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis. If, despite recommendations against, oral glucocorticoids are given to quickly alleviate severe symptoms when an IAGC is not available or feasible, or prior to the onset of action of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) Conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended if there is an inadequate response to scheduled NSAIDs and/or IAGCs for active
