surgical dilation with intralesional glucocorticoid injection alone. Subglottic or endobronchial stenoses should be managed by an otolaryngologist or pulmonologist, respectively, with expertise in management of these lesions. Immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for initial treatment of active inflammatory stenoses and usually comprises glucocorticoids and other agents Recommendation: For patients with GPA and mass lesions (e.g., orbital pseudotumor or masses of the parotid glands, brain, or lungs), we conditionally recommend treatment with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical removal of the mass lesion with immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy (with remission induction followed by remission maintenance) is almost always the initial treatment of choice for mass lesions Other considerations Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend against dosing immunosuppressive therapy based on ANCA titer results alone.
