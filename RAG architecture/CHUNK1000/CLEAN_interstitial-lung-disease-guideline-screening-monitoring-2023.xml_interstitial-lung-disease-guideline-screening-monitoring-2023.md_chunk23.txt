be initiated through shared discussion with the patient. Screening for ILD will typically be initiated by rheumatologists because people with SARDs usually do not see a pulmonologist until after a diagnosis of ILD. Frequency of testing was also discussed. Guidance on the frequency of testing across diseases was provided to support guideline implementation. This guidance on testing frequency is not based on evidence but rather expert opinion and patient preferences. Patients with a highly active underlying SARD warrant more frequent monitoring. Pulmonologists generally see more progressive than long-standing, stable disease and prefer more frequent monitoring. Similarly, the Patient Panel expressed that there is "nothing worse than being missed" and strongly preferred more frequent testing to be reassured that their disease is stable. Because the guideline's target population included people with SARDs who have stable ILD as well as those with progressive ILD, it was important to
