sulfasalazine and pamidronate were suggested as alternatives for the treatment of patients with active disease and contraindications to TNFi, while the current recommendations suggest use of secukinumab or ixekizumab in most of these cases (except patients with high risk of infections). In cases of failure of TNFi, the 2015 guidelines included a conditional recommendation for a trial of a second TNFi and against use of a non-TNFi biologic, whereas the current guidelines differentiate treatment recommendations based on whether there was primary or secondary nonresponse to the TNFi. For the treatment of patients with recurrent uveitis, the previous guidelines specified conditional use of infliximab or adalimumab, while the update broadened this recommendation to include TNFi monoclonal antibodies generally. Similarly, for patients with coexisting IBD, the update includes a conditional recommendation for TNFi monoclonal antibodies over other biologics, rather than over only etanercept.
