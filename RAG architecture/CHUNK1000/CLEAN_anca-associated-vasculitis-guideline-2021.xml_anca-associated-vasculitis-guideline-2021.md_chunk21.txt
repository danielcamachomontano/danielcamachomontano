who have hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g., IgG <3 gm/liter) and recurrent severe infections, we conditionally recommend immunoglobulin supplementation. Immunoglobulin supplementation at replacement doses (e.g., 400-800 mg/kg/month) should be considered if a patient has hypogammaglobulinemia and is experiencing recurrent infections. Immunoglobulin supplementation can also be considered for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia without recurrent infections but with impaired vaccine responses Ungraded position statement: The duration of nonglucocor ticoid remission maintenance therapy in GPA/MPA should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values. The optimal duration of remission maintenance therapy is not well established. Although clinical trials have typically administered remission maintenance therapy for â‰¥18 months, patients may benefit from continuing remission maintenance therapy for a longer duration Ungraded position statement: The duration of glucocorticoid
