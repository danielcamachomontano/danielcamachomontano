years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months, we strongly recommended initial clinical fracture risk assessment including symptomatic and asymptomatic fracture history, FRAX (age ≥40 only), and BMD with VFA or spine x-rays over no assessment (PICO 8.1-8.4). These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence. Initial assessment should occur as soon as possible within 6 months of GC therapy initiation. Clinical fracture risk assessment includes dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures (traumatic, fragility, asymptomatic), low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (Figure 1 1
