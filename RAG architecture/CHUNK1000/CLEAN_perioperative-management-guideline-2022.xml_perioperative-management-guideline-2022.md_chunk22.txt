should supplement the usual perioperative clinical assessment, risk benefit discussions, and management for clinical optimization prior to surgery. We continue to support ongoing research to better inform perioperative management of medications used commonly in rheumatic diseases. While we have added to our information base regarding GC management and the timing of biologic infusion therapy, we still lack high-level data from randomized controlled trials to provide clearer answers to the important questions addressed in the guideline. Data concerning traditional synthetic DMARDs should be updated with randomized controlled trials, and data regarding perioperative management of biologics also needs more definitive study. Patients with rheumatic diseases have higher rates of concomitant metabolic syndrome and cardiac disease and may also be at potentially higher risk of perioperative cardiac and/or thromboembolic events. Therefore, consideration of the role of comorbidities and the
