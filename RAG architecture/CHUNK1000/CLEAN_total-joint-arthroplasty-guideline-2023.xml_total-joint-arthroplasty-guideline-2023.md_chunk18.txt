35-39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <35. Recommendations 7-9 are conditional because there may be exceptions to these recommendations, and the evidence supporting a preoperative weight reduction and a rigid BMI or weight threshold is indirect and very low quality. A majority of the studies supporting all 3 recommendations were based on comparing TJA outcomes in patients who underwent bariatric surgical procedures to the outcomes of those who did not, which are confounded by effects of bariatric surgery, including malnutrition and metabolic syndrome, or comparing outcomes in patients with obesity to outcomes in patients who had a lower BMI. It is well-established that a greater BMI in TJA patients is associated with greater medical and surgical risks, particularly periprosthetic joint infection In our defined population with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA to improve
