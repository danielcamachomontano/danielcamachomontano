influence on the decision to follow a treat-to-target approach in this population compared to patients who are bDMARD-and tsDMARD-naive. A minimal initial treatment goal of low disease activity is conditionally recommended over a goal of remission An initial target of low disease activity is preferred because remission by established criteria may not be achievable for many patients Modification of DMARD(s) Addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over triple therapy (i.e., addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) for patients taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate who are not at target The panel vigorously debated whether to recommend addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD versus sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) for patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate monotherapy in view of very low-certainty evidence favoring bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, randomized controlled trials demonstrating equivalent long-term outcomes across both
