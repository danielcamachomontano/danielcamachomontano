people with SARD-ILD. We provide guidance on the risk factors and frequency of testing to evaluate for the development of ILD in people with SARDs. The risk of ILD varies among people with an established diagnosis of an SARD. Screening tests should not be applied routinely to all people with SARDs. Rather, screening should be focused on people with an SARD of interest who have an increased risk of developing ILD. We summarize published risk factors as a guide, but clinicians are not limited to just these risk factors. We acknowledge that, in some cases, screening may identify mild, asymptomatic ILD that is not progressive. The high morbidity of ILD once symptomatic, emergence of more effective treatments, and general preference of the Patient Panel for screening to identify ILD early contributed to our recommendations. Screening may be initiated through shared discussion with the patient. Screening for ILD will typically be initiated by rheumatologists because people with SARDs
