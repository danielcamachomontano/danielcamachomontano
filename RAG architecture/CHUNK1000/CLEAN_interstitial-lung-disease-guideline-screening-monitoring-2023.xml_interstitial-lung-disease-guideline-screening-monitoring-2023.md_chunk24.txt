Because the guideline's target population included people with SARDs who have stable ILD as well as those with progressive ILD, it was important to provide a wide and flexible range for frequency of testing that could be tailored to patients' needs. Because the guidance on frequency was based on expert opinion and patient preferences rather than evidence, we aimed for uniformity in our recommendations across diseases to ease implementation. We recognize that the frequency of monitoring will vary based on individual disease presentation and shared decision-making with each patient. It was challenging for this group to reach consensus on the recommendation for ambulatory oxygen desaturation testing and the frequency of this testing. In people with Raynaud phenomenon, oxygen desaturation testing using a finger probe may not be accurate and, thus, may lead to the inappropriate prescription of supplemental oxygen. In such cases, ear or forehead probes offer potential for greater accuracy.
