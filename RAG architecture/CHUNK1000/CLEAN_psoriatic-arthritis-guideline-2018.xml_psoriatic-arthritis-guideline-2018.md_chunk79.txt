<p>*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p>

<p>Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine, or apremilast and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor.</p>

<p>† When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.</p>
