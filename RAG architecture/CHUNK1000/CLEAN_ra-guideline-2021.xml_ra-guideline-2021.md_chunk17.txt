of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with DMARDs should allow less use of glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes. Addition of/switching to DMARDs (with or without intraarticular [IA] glucocorticoids) is conditionally recommended over the use of IA glucocorticoids alone for patients taking DMARDs who are not at target This recommendation was based on the premise that DMARDs should be adjusted to reduce disease activity, irrespective of treatment with IA glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because patients may choose to defer adding/switching DMARDs if they obtain relief from IA injection(s). Recommendations for tapering/discontinuing DMARDs (Table 5) Because of the moderate-to-high risk for
