of very low-certainty evidence favoring bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, randomized controlled trials demonstrating equivalent long-term outcomes across both treatment strategies, and significantly less societal cost associated with triple therapy 1 Switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD of a different class is conditionally recommended over switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD belonging to the same class for patients taking a bDMARD or tsDMARD who are not at target The recommendation is based on very low-certainty evidence supporting greater improvement in disease activity and drug survival among patients switching classes. The recommendation is conditional because patient and physician preferences are likely to vary based on prior experiences with specific DMARDs. Use of glucocorticoids Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with
