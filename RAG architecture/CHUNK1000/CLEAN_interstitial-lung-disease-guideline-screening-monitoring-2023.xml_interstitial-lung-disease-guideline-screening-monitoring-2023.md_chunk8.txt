recognized that RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD all confer an increased risk of ILD development compared to the general population. However, it was also recognized that the risks of ILD development and progression vary among and within these diseases. For example, people with RA have low frequency (ie, 3%-5% of people with RA) of progressive ILD, and a larger proportion have asymptomatic or stable disease. SSc confers a higher risk of ILD compared with other SARDs, but a subset of people with long-standing limited cutaneous SSc can have mild, stable ILD. Patients with RA-ILD with high-titer anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) or rheumatoid factor positivity, patients with SSc-ILD with early diffuse cutaneous disease and/or Scl-70 positivity, and patients with IIM-ILD with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (anti-MDA-5), anti-synthetase, or overlap antibodies (eg, PM-Scl, Ku, Ro52) are at increased risk for ILD progression. Thus, screening must be tailored to an
