the risk of plasma exchange may outweigh the benefit; however, in patients with a higher risk of progression to ESRD, the decrease in risk could outweigh the increased risk of serious infection with plasma exchange. Therefore, the Voting Panel does not recommend plasma exchange for all patients with active glomerulonephritis but favors consideration of the treatment for patients at a higher risk of progression to ESRD. Factors that could influence whether plasma exchange is initiated include the patient's kidney function upon presentation, rate of loss of kidney function, response to remission induction therapies, and the patient's ability to tolerate serious infections. Recommendation/statement PICO question informing recommendation and discussion Level of evidence Treatment of sinonasal, airway, and mass lesions Ungraded position statement: For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and GCs) may be beneficial.
