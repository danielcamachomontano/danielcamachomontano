medication changes and demonstration of tolerability and disease stability, usually a minimum of several months. MTX, MMF, CYC, and thalidomide are known teratogens. We strongly recommend discontinuation of these within 3 months prior to conception Data regarding timing of discontinuation are conflicting and do not permit more specific recommendations. However, discontinuation within 1 menstrual cycle would represent the minimum, and 3 months the most common, period for discontinuation. In addition to concerns about teratogenicity, it is optimal to allow adequate time for observation of disease stability without medication. For women treated with leflunomide, we strongly recommend cholestyramine washout if there are detectable serum levels of metabolite prior to or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Once metabolite is not detectable in the serum, the risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects are not elevated We conditionally recommend treatment with CYC for life-threatening conditions
