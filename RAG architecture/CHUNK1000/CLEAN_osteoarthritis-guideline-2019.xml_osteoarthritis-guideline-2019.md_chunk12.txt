current evidence Table 1 http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41142/ abstract In the majority of studies that assessed the role of aerobic exercise in the management of OA, walking was the most common form of exercise evaluated, either on a treadmill or as supervised, community-based, indoor fitness walking. Other studies used supervised group cycling on stationary bicycles. Strengthening exercises have included the use of isokinetic weight machines, resistance exercise training with and without props such as elastic bands, and isometric exercise. Neuromuscular training has been developed to address muscle weakness, reduced sensorimotor control, and functional instability specifically seen with knee OA, with a series of dynamic maneuvers of increased complexity. Aquatic exercise often encompasses aspects of aerobic fitness exercises and exercises for enhancing joint range of motion, in a low-impact environment. A specific hierarchy of these various forms of exercise could
