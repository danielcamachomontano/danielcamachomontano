10. 1002/ acr.24634/ abstract Table 1 2 1 Remission induction for active, severe disease Recommendation: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction. Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA. Rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial Cyclophosphamide (dosing provided in Table 1 Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA with active glomerulonephritis, we conditionally recommend against the routine addition of plasma exchange to remission induction therapy. Plasma exchange should not be initiated in all patients with active glomerulonephritis but can be considered for patients at higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who accept a potential increased risk of infection. This recommendation is
