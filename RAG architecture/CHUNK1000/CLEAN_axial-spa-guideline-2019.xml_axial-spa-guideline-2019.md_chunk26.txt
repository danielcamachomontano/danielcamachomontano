with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 69). In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spine or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 82). Because the clinical assessment of inflammation in axial SpA has many limitations, questions may arise about whether subclinical inflammation that could be detected by MRI is being "missed" by either the physical examination, symptoms, or laboratory studies. Given the lack of evidence that obtaining an MRI in stable patients improves clinical outcomes, the only moderate sensitivity and specificity of MRI-defined abnormalities for measurement of activity in axial SpA, the burden of testing, and concern for possible overtreatment, the panel recommended against obtaining an MRI in this setting. MRI could be considered in circumstances where the clinician and patient differ in their assessment of whether the disease
