when GC are discontinued (Figure 5 For adults taking OP therapy and discontinuing GC therapy, with no new fragility fracture and a current BMD t-score ≥-2.5, we strongly recommended stopping current OP therapy and continuing calcium and vitamin D. However, sequential therapy is strongly recommended after stopping DEN, PTH/PTHrP, and ROM (Figure 5 This recommendation is based on low-certainty evidence and on the balance of benefits and harms of continued treatment with OP medication. BP and RAL can be discontinued without need for sequential therapy. DEN, PTH/PTHrP, and ROM should be transitioned to anti-resorptive therapy, but the best formulation and duration of treatment is unclear at this time For adults ≥40 years discontinuing GC therapy and continuing to be at high risk of fracture (BMD t-score ≤-2.5, or history of a fragility fracture occurring after ≥12 months of therapy), we conditionally recommend continuing current OP therapy or switching to another class of OP medication
