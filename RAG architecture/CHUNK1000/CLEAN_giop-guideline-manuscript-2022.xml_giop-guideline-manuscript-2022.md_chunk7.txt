not to start OP therapy (except calcium and vitamin D), we strongly recommend fracture risk reassessment every 1 to 2 years (PICO 9.1-9.4). Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Fracture risk reassessment includes clinical fracture risk history, new symptomatic fractures, FRAX, BMD, VFA, and/or spine x-rays. Repeating DXA assessment every 1 to 2 years allows providers to detect the least significant BMD change according to their DXA machine, triggering the need to start OP therapy. For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day and assessed as moderate, high, or very high fracture risk who are continuing OP therapy ≥1 year, we strongly recommend fracture risk re-assessment every 1 to 2 years over no risk reassessment (PICO 9.5-9.12). Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are
