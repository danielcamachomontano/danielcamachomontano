with prophylactic-dose anticoagulation for 6-12 weeks post partum In pregnant women with thrombotic APS, we strongly recommend treating with low-dose aspirin and therapeuticdose heparin (usually LMWH) throughout pregnancy and post partum. We conditionally recommend against using the combination of prophylactic-dose heparin and low-dose aspirin therapy for patients with positive aPL who do not meet criteria for OB APS. We appreciate and stress, however, that benefit in individual high-risk circumstances, such as triple-positive aPL or strongly positive LAC results, advanced maternal age, or IVF pregnancy, may outweigh risks of this therapy, and decisions should be made with discussion between physician and patient, weighing potential risks and benefits. Other therapies for refractory OB APS. Despite improved outcomes with standard therapy with low-dose aspirin and prophylactic heparin/LMWH, additional treatments are needed for patients who do not respond to standard therapy.
