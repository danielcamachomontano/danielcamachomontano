the low risk of osteoporotic fractures in children and youth ages 4 to 17 years (PICO 7.1a-7.5a). For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years with an osteoporotic fracture who are continuing treatment with chronic GC at a dose of ≥0.1 mg/kg/day for >3 months, treating with an oral or IV BP is conditionally recommended over no treatment.  This conditional recommendation to treat with oral or IV BP to prevent recurrent fractures is based on low-certainty evidence. Depending on the specific disease or cause of pediatric OP, there is uncertainty about when and how to screen, and depending on the guidelines, it requires a history of clinically significant fracture(s), defined as ≥1 vertebral fractures, ≥2 long bone fractures prior to age 10 years, or ≥3 long bone fractures up to age 19 years Recommendations for initial treatment failure For adults continuing GC treatment who have had an osteoporotic fracture ≥12 months after starting OP therapy, or who have had a significant loss of BMD (eg,
