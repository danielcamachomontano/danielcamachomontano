IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are extremely effective and welltolerated treatments for systemic JIA  and have been rapidly adopted in clinical practice Some voting panelists preferred starting with a short-acting agent such as anakinra, but in the absence of controlled studies, no preferred agent was endorsed. Patients/caregivers noted preference for fewer injections, if possible. As response to individual agents is variable, switching among and between IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors when needed due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability is appropriate. Concerns were expressed
