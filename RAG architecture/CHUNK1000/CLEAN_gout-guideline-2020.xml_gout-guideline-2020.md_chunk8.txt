recommended for gout patients with any of the following: ≥1 subcutaneous tophi; evidence of radiographic damage (any modality) attributable to gout; OR frequent gout flares, with frequent being defined as ≥2 annually. From the ULT NMA (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract 1 1 http://onlinelibrary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract Initiating ULT is conditionally recommended for patients who have previously experienced >1 flare but have infrequent flares (<2/year). For patients with less frequent flares and no tophi, the potential clinical benefit of ULT would be lower than the ULT benefit for patients with more burdensome gout. In a single study (moderate certainty of evidence), patients with ≤2 previous flares (and no more than 1 gout flare in the preceding year) randomized to receive febuxostat (versus placebo) were less likely to experience a subsequent flare (30% versus 41%; P < 0.05) Specific
