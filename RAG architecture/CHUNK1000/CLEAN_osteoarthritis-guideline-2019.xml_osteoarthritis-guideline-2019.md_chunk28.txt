remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management of OA, and their use is strongly recommended. A large number of trials have established their short-term efficacy. Oral NSAIDs are the initial oral medication of choice in the treatment of OA, regardless of anatomic location, and are recommended over all other available oral medications. While this guideline did not address the relative merits of different NSAIDs, there is evidence suggesting that certain agents may have more favorable side effect profiles than others Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections are strongly recommended for patients with knee and/or hip OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. Trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy in knee OA. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally, rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the
