| <strong>FRAX® GC correction</strong>                                      | If GC dose is &gt;7.5 mg/day, multiply the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture by 1.15 and the hip fracture risk by 1.2 | <em>Not applicable as FRAX® is not validated in this age group</em> |
| <strong>Very high fracture risk</strong>                                  | Prior OP fracture(s) OR BMD T score ≤ -3.5 OR FRAX® (GC-Adjusted<em>) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% OR High GC ≥30 mg/day for &gt;30 days OR cumulative doses ≥5 g/year | Prior fracture(s) OR GC ≥30mg/day OR cumulative ≥5grams/year |
| <strong>High fracture risk</strong>                                       | BMD T score ≤ -2.5 but &gt; -3.5 OR FRAX® (GC-Adjusted</em>) 10-year risk of MOF ≥20% but &lt;30% or hip ≥3% but &lt;4.5% | BMD T score ≤ -2.5 but &gt; -3.5 OR FRAX® (GC-Adjusted*) 10-year risk of MOF ≥20% but &lt;30% or hip ≥3% but &lt;4.5% |
