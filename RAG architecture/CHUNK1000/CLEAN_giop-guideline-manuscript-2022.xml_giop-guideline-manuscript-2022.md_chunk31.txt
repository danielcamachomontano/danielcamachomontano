|PTH/PTHrP Agonists (TER, ABL, Anti-RANKL, DEN)|We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DENÂ§# or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.|-|
|Selective estrogen receptor modifier (RAL), Anti-sclerostin (ROM)|We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture. Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death.|-|</p>
