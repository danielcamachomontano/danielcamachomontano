without infection, continuation of rituximab therapy for patients at target is conditionally recommended over switching to a different bDMARD or tsDMARD Continuing rituximab in patients who are at target is preferred because of the uncertain clinical significance of hypogammaglobulinemia in patients without infection. Although an increased risk of infection has been described in RA patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, it is not known if a switch in DMARDs in patients who are at target is more effective in lowering infection risk while maintaining disease control than continuation of rituximab. The recommendation is conditional because physician and patient risk tolerance is likely to vary depending on the degree of hypogammaglobulinemia and patient-specific risk factors for infection. Previous serious infection Addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with a serious infection within the previous 12 months who have
