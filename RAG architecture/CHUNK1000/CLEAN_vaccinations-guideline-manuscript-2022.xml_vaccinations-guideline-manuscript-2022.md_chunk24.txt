in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate." Low quality means that "further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate." Very low quality means that "we are very uncertain about the estimate." In the systematic review for this guideline, a judgment of moderate quality required at least some evidence from randomized controlled trials, and a judgment of low quality required at least some evidence from well-designed observational studies with appropriate comparator groups. â€¡ Indirect evidence indicates that there is evidence from other populations with RMD or other health conditions, or evidence that does not fully address the comparison specified in a PICO question. 21514658, 2023, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045, Wiley Online Library on [24/02/2023].
