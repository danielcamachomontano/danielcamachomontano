whether other conditions such as infection could be mimicking vasculitis. However, if a patient's disease is refractory to one remission induction therapy, it is important to change the remission induction strategy. We recommend switching to the other remission induction agent prior to using combination therapy. Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA that is refractory to remission induction therapy, we conditionally recommend adding IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) to current therapy. IVIG should not be used routinely to treat GPA/MPA but can be considered at certain treatment doses (e.g., 2 gm/kg) as adjunctive therapy for short-term control, while waiting for remission induction therapy (i.e., rituximab or cyclophosphamide) to become effective (see above recommendation) Treatment of sinonasal, airway, and mass lesions Ungraded position statement: For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and glucocorticoids) may be
