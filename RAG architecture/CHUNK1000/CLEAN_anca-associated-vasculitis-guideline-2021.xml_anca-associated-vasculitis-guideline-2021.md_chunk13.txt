experience venous thrombotic events.  Plasma exchange remains advisable in patients with GPA or MPA who also have anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Recommendation: In patients with active, severe GPA/MPA with alveolar hemorrhage, we conditionally recommend against adding plasma exchange to remission induction therapies. Two trials evaluated the use of plasma exchange in patients presenting with alveolar hemorrhage, and no differences in mortality or remission rates were observed. Thus, plasma exchange does not have an established benefit for patients with alveolar hemorrhage and is associated with an increased risk of serious infection (see above recommendation). Plasma exchange may be considered for certain patients with active glomerulonephritis or those who are critically ill and whose disease is not responding to recommended remission induction therapies (i.e., plasma exchange as "salvage" or "rescue" therapy). Plasma exchange remains advisable in patients with GPA or MPA
