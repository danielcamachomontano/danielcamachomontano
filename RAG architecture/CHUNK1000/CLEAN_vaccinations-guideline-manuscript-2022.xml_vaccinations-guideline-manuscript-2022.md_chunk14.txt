patients developed vaccine-associated infection, and 7 of 17 patients experienced disease flares JAK inhibitors. Cutaneous vaccine-strain varicella infection developed in 1 of 55 RA patients given a single dose of the live attenuated VZV vaccine 2-3 weeks prior to tofacitinib initiation in the context of an RCT. Later testing demonstrated that the study participant lacked prevaccination immunity to VZV Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Antiviral antibodies contained in IVIG can interfere with replication of live attenuated vaccines and reduce their efficacy Specific recommendations for holding medications if live attenuated vaccines are given. Although the evidence around the safety of conventional DMARDs and TNFi at the time of live attenuated virus vaccination is reassuring, the total number of RMD patients who have been studied is small, and the Voting Panel conditionally recommended against administering live attenuated virus vaccines to patients receiving those agents as well as
