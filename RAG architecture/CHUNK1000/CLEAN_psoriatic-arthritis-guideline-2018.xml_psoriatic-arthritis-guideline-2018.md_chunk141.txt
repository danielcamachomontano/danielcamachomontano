| Conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence; may consider no exercise in patients with existing muscle/tendon injury or multiple inflamed symptomatic joints with worsening pain with exercise. |                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2. Recommend low-impact exercise (e.g., tai chi, yoga, swimming) over high-impact exercise (e.g., running) (PICO 2) | Very low                                                                                                                                                               |
| Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider high-impact exercise due to patient preference. |                                                                                                                                                                         |
