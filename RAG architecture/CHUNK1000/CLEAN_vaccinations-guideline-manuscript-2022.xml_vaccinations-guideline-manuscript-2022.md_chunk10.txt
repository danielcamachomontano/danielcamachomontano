non-live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended. For patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily, administering influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended. For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily, deferring non-live attenuated vaccinations, other than influenza vaccination, until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg daily is conditionally recommended. Most studies that have compared prednisone <10 mg daily to prednisone ≥10 mg daily found that the higher dosages did reduce influenza vaccine immunogenicity Given the importance of timely influenza vaccination, a conditional recommendation was made to administer influenza vaccination to patients receiving the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily. For vaccines other than for influenza, a conditional recommendation was made to delay vaccination until the dose is lower to maximize vaccine efficacy. It is understood, however,
