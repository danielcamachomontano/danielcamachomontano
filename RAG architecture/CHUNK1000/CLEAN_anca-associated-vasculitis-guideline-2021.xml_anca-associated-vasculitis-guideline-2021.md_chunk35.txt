mofetil rather than glucocorticoids alone in order to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. One randomized trial that combined patients with EGPA, MPA, and polyarteritis nodosa without poor prognosis factors showed that the addition of azathioprine did not provide benefit beyond glucocorticoids alone | 1101 Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over cyclophosphamide or rituximab and glucocorticoids. While the comparative efficacy of methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab is not well established, the use of methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is favored, based on more experience with these agents in EGPA compared to rituximab. However, rituximab may be considered if other agents are not effective in controlling active, nonsevere disease, or if the patient has nonsevere vasculitis (which in some series
