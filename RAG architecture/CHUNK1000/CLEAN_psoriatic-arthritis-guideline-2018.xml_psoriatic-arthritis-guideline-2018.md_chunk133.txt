<p>|In adult patients with active PsA needing vaccinations,‡|Level of evidence (evidence [refs.] reviewed)†|
|---|---|
|1. Start the biologic and administer killed vaccines over delaying the start of biologic to administer killed vaccines (PICO 56)|Very low (121–126)|
|Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider delaying the start of biologic to administer killed vaccines due to patient preference based on patient belief about vaccine efficacy.| |
|2. Delay the start of biologic to administer live attenuated vaccines over starting the biologic and administering live attenuated vaccines (PICO 57)|Very low (127)|
|Conditional recommendation based on very-low-quality evidence; may consider starting the biologic and administering live attenuated vaccines in patients with very active severe joint§ or skin¶ disease who prefer no delay in biologic initiation.| |</p>
