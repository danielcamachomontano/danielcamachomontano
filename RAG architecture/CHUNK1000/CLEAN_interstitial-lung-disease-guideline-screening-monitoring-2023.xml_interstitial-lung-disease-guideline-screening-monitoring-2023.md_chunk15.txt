indirect evidence for this recommendation. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs and HRCT chest over PFTs alone. Thirteen studies (16 articles, For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with ambulatory desaturation testing. There was no published evidence in people with SARDassociated ILD, but, as is standard in other forms of ILD, recognition of ambulatory desaturation informs the need for oxygen use. Concerns were raised about accurate oxygen saturation measurement in patients with Raynaud phenomenon, particularly those with SSc, because of poor finger perfusion. Thus, an ear or forehead oxygen saturation monitor is preferable in these circumstances. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with chest radiography. One case-control study demonstrated a low sensitivity (64.0%) and moderate specificity (73.6%) of chest radiography relative to HRCT chest for identifying ILD among patients with
