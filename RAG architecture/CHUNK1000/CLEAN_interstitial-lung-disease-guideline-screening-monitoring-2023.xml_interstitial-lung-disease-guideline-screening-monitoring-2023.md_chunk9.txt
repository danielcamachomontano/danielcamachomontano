anti-synthetase, or overlap antibodies (eg, PM-Scl, Ku, Ro52) are at increased risk for ILD progression. Thus, screening must be tailored to an individual patient, recognizing the need for shared decision-making. Although most people with SSc and many people with IIM warrant screening, it is not necessary to screen all people with RA or SjD. The Voting Panel voted on recommendations for people at higher risk of ILD within each disease. Although defining the magnitude of risk within diseases was beyond the scope of this guideline, Table 1 1 2 For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with PFTs over history and physical examination or ambulatory desaturation testing alone. Given the poor diagnostic accuracy of history (dry cough: 15% sensitive, 89% specific) and examination (dry "velcro" crackles: 69% sensitive, 66% specific), despite very low certainty of evidence (one observational study), For people with SARDs at increased risk of
