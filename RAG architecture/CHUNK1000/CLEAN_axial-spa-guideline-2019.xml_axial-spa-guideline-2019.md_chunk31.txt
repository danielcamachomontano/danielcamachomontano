IBD, the update includes a conditional recommendation for TNFi monoclonal antibodies over other biologics, rather than over only etanercept. Finally, the recommendation for use of TNFi in patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA was changed from conditional to strong. New questions on the treatment of patients with stable disease were addressed in this update. Discontinuation of biologics is not recommended due to the likelihood for symptom recurrence. If tapering is considered, patients should be counseled regarding the potential for increased disease activity. Co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate is not generally recommended, but ongoing studies will shed further light on this question. Switching to a biosimilar during the course of treatment with TNFi is also not recommended, echoing the concerns previously expressed by the ACR Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of axial SpA, but its role in monitoring patients is less well-defined.
