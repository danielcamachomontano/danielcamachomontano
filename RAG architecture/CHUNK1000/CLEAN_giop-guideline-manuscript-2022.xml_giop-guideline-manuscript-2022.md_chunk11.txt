including thrombosis, fatal stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death (PICO 1.6b, 1.10b, 1.12b, 1.16b, 1.17b, 1.21b, 1.22b, 1.23b, 1.24b, 1.25b, 1.28b, 2.9, 2.14, 2.18, 2.21). Multiple studies have shown that 12 months of ROM followed by an anti-resorptive agent (BP or DEN) for 12 month prevents fractures in patients with postmenopausal OP when compared to antiresorptive agent only In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or ROM (PICO 1.4a-1.28a). Adults <40 years have low fracture risk and have significant capacity to rebuild BMD losses induced by chronic GC therapy. OP therapy should not be started in this low-risk group Recommendations for special populations of patients beginning long-term GC therapy at very high risk for fracture (Table 2 For adults ≥40 years at very high fracture risk due to treatment with one or more courses of high-dose GC therapy (mean dose prednisone equivalent ≥30 mg daily for ≥30 days)
