a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68). In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 81). Because physical and laboratory measures are often normal despite active axial SpA, and because symptoms may be nonspecific, it may be difficult to know whether a patient is experiencing inflammation that warrants a change in treatment. Limited evidence suggests that knowledge of MRI findings in the spine and sacroiliac joints may alter treatment recommendations. However, the degree of inflammatory change on MRI may not correlate with treatment responses, and the location of inflam-mation on MRI may not correlate with the location of pain http://onlin elibr ary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 69).
