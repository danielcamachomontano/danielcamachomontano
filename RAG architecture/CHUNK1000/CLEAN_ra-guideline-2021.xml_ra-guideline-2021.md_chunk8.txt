to outweigh potential benefits. Initiation of a csDMARD without longerterm (â‰¥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity Although some patients may require longer-term glucocorticoids, this strong recommendation against longer-term glucocorticoid therapy is made because of its significant toxicity. Recommendations for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity (Table 2) Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARDnaive patients with low disease activity Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA. Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate because it is less immunosuppressive, and
