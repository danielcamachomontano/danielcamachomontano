the research agenda (containing the evidence gaps related to PMR management) is an important result of this project (Box 2). Due to our rigorous SLR approach to select high quality papers, we did not include other reviews, case reports or case series indicating possible treatment options in treatment-resistant PMR patients. For example, we found one earlier SLR reporting similar conclusions regarding the value of MTX in PMR It was beyond the scope of this recommendation project to define treatment targets in PMR.
