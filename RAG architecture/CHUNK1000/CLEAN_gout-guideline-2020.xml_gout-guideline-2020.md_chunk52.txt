|For patients with gout taking their first XOI monotherapy at maximum-tolerated or FDA-indicated dose who are not at SU target and/or have continued frequent gout flares or nonresolving subcutaneous tophi, we conditionally recommend switching the first XOI to an alternate XOI agent over adding a uricosuric agent.|24|Very low|
|For patients with gout where XOI, uricosurics, and other interventions have failed to achieve SU target and who have frequent gout flares or nonresolving subcutaneous tophi, we strongly recommend switching to pegloticase over continuing current ULT.†|27|Moderate|
|For patients with gout for whom XOI, uricosurics, and other interventions have failed to achieve serum urate target and who have infrequent gout flares (&lt;2 flares/year) and no tophi, we strongly recommend against switching to pegloticase over continuing current ULT.‡|27|Moderate|</p>
