the efficacy and durability of response to all vaccines across all age groups; 2) safety of primary and booster live attenuated virus vaccination in children taking methotrexate and/or biologic DMARDs; 3) assessment of the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and disease flares following standard-dose, high-dose, and adjuvanted influenza vaccination, recombinant VZV vaccination, and primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination in RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication; and 4) RCTs to test the safety and efficacy of holding DMARDs around the time of vaccination.  â€  The terms 'moderate', 'low', and 'very low' are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions for quality of evidence. Moderate quality means that "further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate." Low quality means that "further research is very likely to have an important impact on our
