transfer and fetal exposure for most biologic therapies vary with gestational stage. The majority of RMD biologic therapies contain an Fc IgG1 construct that does not cross into the fetal circulation in significant concentrations until the second trimester There are limited data on the compatibility of other biologics with pregnancy. Given that these agents likely do not cross the placenta until the second trimester, the panel conditionally recommends that non-TNF inhibitor IgG-based molecules are compatible in the periconception period but should be discontinued during pregnancy (i.e. at the time of the first positive pregnancy test result). We conditionally recommend continuing treatment with anakinra, belimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab while a woman is trying to conceive, but discontinuing once she is found to be pregnant. If disease cannot be controlled with medications considered compatible with pregnancy, the physician and patient should discuss and
