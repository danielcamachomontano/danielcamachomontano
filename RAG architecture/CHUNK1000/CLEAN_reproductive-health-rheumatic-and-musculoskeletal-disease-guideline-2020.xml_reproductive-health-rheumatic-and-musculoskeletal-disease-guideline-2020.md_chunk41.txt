For women with a prior infant with CHB or other NLE we conditionally recommend fetal echocardiography weekly, starting at week 16-18 and continuing through week 26. Recommendations regarding monitoring for and treatment of CHB in women with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB are all conditional. Given the rarity of CHB, large case series are not available; most studies are retrospective and not randomized. An argument against screening includes the risk of identification and treatment of artifacts that do not
