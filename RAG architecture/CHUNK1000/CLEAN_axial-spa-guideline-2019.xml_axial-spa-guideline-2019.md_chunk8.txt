with active or stable AS on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach. Very low * AS = ankylosing spondylitis; PICO = population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes; NSAIDs = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; CRP = C-reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; ASDAS = Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score; DXA = dual x-ray absorptiometry; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging. â€  These recommendations were from 2015 and were not reviewed in this update. The number preceding the recommendation is the recommendation number and is referenced as bracketed numbers in Figure 1 uncertainty regarding potential disease-modifying effects, the committee conditionally favored continuous use of NSAIDs in patients with active AS, primarily for controlling disease activity. The decision to use NSAIDs continuously may vary
