but studies in women with HIV show no increase In women with RMD who are at increased risk for osteoporosis from glucocorticoid use or underlying disease, we conditionally recommend against using DMPA as a longterm contraceptive because data suggest that bone mineral density declines by up to 7.5% over 2 years of use in a healthy population Although there are no published data suggesting increased fracture risk, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends caution regarding DMPA use in women with or at increased risk for osteoporosis We conditionally recommend that women with RMD taking mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF) use an IUD alone or 2 other methods of contraception together, because MMF may reduce serum estrogen and progesterone levels (in turn reducing the efficacy of oral contraceptives).
