<p>† The terms ‘moderate’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’ are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions for quality of evidence. Moderate quality means that “further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.” Low quality means that “further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.” Very low quality means that “we are very uncertain about the estimate.” In the systematic review for this guideline, a judgment of moderate quality required at least some evidence from randomized controlled trials, and a judgment of low quality required at least some evidence from well‐designed observational studies with appropriate comparator groups.</p>
