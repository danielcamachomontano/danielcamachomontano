The recommendation is conditional because patient preferences play an important role in the decision whether to continue methotrexate or switch to other DMARDs. Switching to subcutaneous methotrexate is conditionally recommended over the addition of/ switching to alternative DMARD(s) for patients taking oral methotrexate who are not at target This recommendation is consistent with the voting panel's overarching principle of maximizing use of methotrexate prior to switching/adding DMARDs.

The recommendation is conditional because patient preferences and the magnitude of previous response to
