and the Voting Panel conditionally recommended against administering live attenuated virus vaccines to patients receiving those agents as well as other forms of immunosuppression. For patients who do need to receive live attenuated vaccines, specific recommendations for holding immunosuppressive medications around the time of vaccination can be found in Table 5 For slow-acting conventional DMARDs, a prevaccination hold time of 4 weeks was chosen to reflect their prolonged duration of action. However, direct evidence for the optimal hold time is lacking. For most biologic DMARDs, a hold time of 1 dosing interval before live attenuated vaccine administration is recommended. The number of RMD patients who are taking immunosuppressive medications at the time that they need live attenuated virus vaccines is small. However, very young children, especially those with autoinflammatory disorders, may require biologic DMARDs before their primary vaccination series is complete. In these
