who are positive for aPL are at increased risk for thrombosis. Most reports of aPL-positive patients undergoing IVF describe the use of empiric prophylactic anticoagulation due to concern regarding further increased risk of potentially life-threatening thrombosis from elevated estrogen levels during ovarian stimulation. In subfertile patients with RMD who desire pregnancy, have stable/quiescent disease, and have asymptomatic positive aPL, OB APS, or treated thrombotic APS, we conditionally recommend ART with anticoagulation, as described below. We conditionally recommend prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin or low molecular weight heparin in asymptomatic aPL-positive patients during ART procedures The increased risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis due to high estrogen levels greatly outweighs the low risk of bleeding or other complications of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). We strongly recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with
