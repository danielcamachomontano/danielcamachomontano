<p><strong>Table 2. Recommendations for choice of initial urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in patients with gout*</strong>
|Recommendation|PICO question|Certainty of evidence|
|---|---|---|
|For patients starting any ULT, we strongly recommend allopurinol over all other ULT as the preferred first-line agent for all patients, including in those with CKD stage &gt;3.|10|Moderate|
|We strongly recommend a xanthine oxidase inhibitor over probenecid for those with CKD stage &gt;3.| | |
|For allopurinol and febuxostat, we strongly recommend starting at a low dose with subsequent dose titration to target over starting at a higher dose (e.g., &lt;100 mg/day [and lower in patients with CKD] for allopurinol or &lt;40 mg/day for febuxostat).|7|Moderate|
|For probenecid, we conditionally recommend starting at a low dose (500 mg once or twice daily) with dose titration over starting at a higher dose.| | |
