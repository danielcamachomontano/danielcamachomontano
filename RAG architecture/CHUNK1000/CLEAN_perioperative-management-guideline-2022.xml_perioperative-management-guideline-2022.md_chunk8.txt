For example, for rituximab, dosed every 6 months, surgery should be planned during month 7, and for adalimumab, dosed every 2 weeks, surgery should be planned for week 3 (see Table 2 For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing THA or TKA, withholding tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib for at least 3 days prior to
