to be a multidisciplinary collaboration between rheumatology and pulmonology. Thus, some recommendations will comment on potential variations in practice between these specialties. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs. PFTs (spirometry, volumes, and DLCO) provide objective data that are helpful in following patients over time. Patients saw benefit in an objective test to help assess disease stability or progression. Although PFTs can reassure both patient and clinician when they are stable, patients commented that PFTs can also be stressful and difficult because of their symptoms of cough or 1 For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with HRCT chest.

For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs and HRCT chest over PFTs
