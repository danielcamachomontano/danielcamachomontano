for OA, its efficacy remains a subject of controversy. Issues related to the use of appropriate blinding, the validity of sham controls, sample size, effect size, and prior expectations have arisen with regard to this literature. Variability in the results of RCTs and meta-analyses is likely driven, in part, by differences in the type of controls and the intensity of the control interventions used. In addition, the benefits of acupuncture result from the large contextual effect plus small differences in outcomes between "true" and "sham" acupuncture. The latter is of the same magnitude as the effect of full-dose acetaminophen versus placebo. The greatest number of positive trials with the largest effect sizes have been carried out in knee OA. Positive trials and meta-analyses have also been published in a variety of other painful conditions and have indicated that acupuncture is effective for analgesia. While the "true" magnitude of effect is difficult to discern, the risk of harm is
