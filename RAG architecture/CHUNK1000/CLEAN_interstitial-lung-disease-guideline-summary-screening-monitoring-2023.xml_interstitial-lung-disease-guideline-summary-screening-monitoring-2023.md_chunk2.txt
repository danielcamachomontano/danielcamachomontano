chest and PFTs over PFTs alone. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with 6MWD. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with ambulatory desaturation testing. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we strongly recommend against screening with surgical lung biopsy. Table 2. Summary of Recommendations for Monitoring for ILD Progression Summary of recommendations For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs. For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with HRCT chest. For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs
