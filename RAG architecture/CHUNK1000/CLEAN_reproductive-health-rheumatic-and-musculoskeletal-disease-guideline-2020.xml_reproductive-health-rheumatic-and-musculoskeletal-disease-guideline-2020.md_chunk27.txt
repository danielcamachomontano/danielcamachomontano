providers. Pregnancy changes may impact manifestations of RMD. Pregnancy-related increased intravascular volume may worsen already abnormal cardiac or renal function. The expected 50% increase in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy may worsen preexisting stable proteinuria. Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability increases RMD-associated thrombosis risk. The calcium demand of fetal bone development and breastfeeding may worsen maternal osteoporosis. In addition, normal pregnancy symptoms such as malar erythema, chloasma gravidarum, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation, and diffuse arthralgias may falsely mimic symptoms of active RMD. Pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes (preeclampsia) may be confused with lupus nephritis, scleroderma renal crisis, or vasculitis flare. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) or eclampsia may resemble severe disease flare. Distinguishing among these syndromes requires the expertise of rheumatologists and
