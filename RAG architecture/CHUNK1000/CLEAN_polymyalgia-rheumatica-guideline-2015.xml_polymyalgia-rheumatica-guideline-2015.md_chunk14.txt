subgroups, and taking current clinical practice into account The group conditionally discourages low (#7.5 mg/ day) and strongly recommends against high (.30 mg/day prednisone equivalent) initial GC doses. For this statement the group extrapolated the data from randomized controlled trials Recommendation 4: (PICO 6) The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose-tapering schedules, based on regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. The following principles of GC dose tapering are suggested: A. Initial tapering: Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4-8 weeks. B. Relapse therapy: Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually (within 4-8 weeks) to the dose at which the relapse occurred. C. Tapering once remission is achieved (following initial and relapse therapies): Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg on
