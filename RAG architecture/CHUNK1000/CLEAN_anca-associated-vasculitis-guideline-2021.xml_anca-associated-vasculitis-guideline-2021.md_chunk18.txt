situation, preferences, and values should guide selection between them, given their comparable efficacy. Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who are receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend scheduled re-dosing over using ANCA titers or CD19+ B cell counts to guide re-dosing. In one randomized trial, patients who received rituximab for remission maintenance based on changes in CD19+ B cell counts and/or ANCA titers had similar rates of relapse as those receiving rituximab as a scheduled dose. However, this study was limited by the small sample size, and there were wide CIs for the effect size Recommendation: For patients with severe GPA/MPA whose disease has entered remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally rec ommend treatment with methotrexate or azathioprine over mycophenolate mofetil for remission maintenance. Methotrexate and azathioprine are equally efficacious for remission maintenance Recommendation:
