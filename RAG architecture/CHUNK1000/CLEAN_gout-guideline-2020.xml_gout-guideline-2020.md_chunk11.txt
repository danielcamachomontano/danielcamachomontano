flares (<2/year), we conditionally recommend initiating ULT over no ULT. Moderate For patients experiencing their first flare, we conditionally recommend against initiating ULT over no ULT, with the following exceptions. Moderate For patients experiencing their first flare and CKD stage >3, SU >9 mg/dl, or urolithiasis, we conditionally recommend initiating ULT. Very low For patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (SU >6.8 mg/dl with no prior gout flares or subcutaneous tophi), we conditionally recommend against initiating any pharmacologic ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid) over initiation of pharmacologic ULT. 57 High † * PICO = population, intervention, comparator, outcomes; CKD = chronic kidney disease; SU = serum urate. † There is randomized clinical trial data to support the benefit that ULT lowers the proportion of patients who develop incident gout. However, based on the attributable risk, 24 patients would need to be treated for 3 years to prevent a single (incident)
