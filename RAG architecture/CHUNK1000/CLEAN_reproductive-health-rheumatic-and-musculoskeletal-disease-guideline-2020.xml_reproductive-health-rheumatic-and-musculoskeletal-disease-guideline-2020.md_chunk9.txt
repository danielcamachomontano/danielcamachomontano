estrogen-containing contraceptives have not been studied in SLE patients with moderate or severe disease activity. Antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients. Presence of aPL, with or without history of clinical complications, is a contraindication to use of estrogen-containing contraceptives due the potential further increase in thrombosis risk. We strongly recommend against combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives in women with positive aPL because estrogen increases risk of thromboembolism. We strongly recommend IUDs (levonorgestrel or copper) or the progestin-only pill in women with positive aPL. In aPL-positive patients, we do not recommend DMPA due to concern regarding thrombogenicity. We do not comment on the relatively new progestin implant due to lack of data. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in healthy women taking combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives is 36 times higher than the baseline annual risk of 1/10,000 women The copper IUD is a highly effective
