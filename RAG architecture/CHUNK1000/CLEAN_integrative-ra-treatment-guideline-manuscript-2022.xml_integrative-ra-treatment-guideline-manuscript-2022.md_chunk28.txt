sample sizes resulting in imprecision; and 4) heterogeneity of study designs (e.g., various interventions [comprehensive therapy versus an individual component], comparators, and outcomes) that prevented pooling results through a formal meta-analysis. Many of these issues are inherent to research evaluating the considered interventions (e.g., exercise, diet). These conditional recommendations indicate that clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients when deciding whether to use these interventions. The low or very low certainty evidence supporting most recommendations calls for prioritizing research into these interventions and prompted a proposed research agenda (Table 7 There are limitations to the development of these guidelines. Studies that were conducted prior to more recent treatment eras (characterized by early diagnosis of RA and a treat-to-target approach) were included in the evidence report and may be less generalizable than more recently completed
