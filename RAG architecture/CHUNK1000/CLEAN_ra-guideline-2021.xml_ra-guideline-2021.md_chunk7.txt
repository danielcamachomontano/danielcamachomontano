given the lack of proven benefit and additional risks and costs associated with the addition of a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD in this patient population. Glucocorticoids Initiation of a csDMARD without short-term (<3 months) glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with short-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity While the voting panel agreed that glucocorticoids should not be systematically prescribed, the recommendation is conditional because all members acknowledged that short-term glucocorticoids are frequently necessary to alleviate symptoms prior to the onset of action of DMARDs. Treatment with glucocorticoids should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.

Initiation of a csDMARD without longerterm (â‰¥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a
