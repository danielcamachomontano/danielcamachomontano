of patients who have moderate-to-severe pain and loss of function and moderate-to-severe radiographic OA or ON with secondary arthritis, using standard radiographic measures such as Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade Patients who have certain risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and nicotine use, may also have surgical treatment delayed by hospital policy or third-party payers in order to meet specific criteria to mitigate their surgical risk. However, while these factors are clearly associated with increased risk for adverse events, it is unknown whether delaying surgery in order to achieve a specific glycemic end point, weight or body mass index (BMI) target, or absolute nicotine cessation leads to improved outcomes after TJA The purpose of this clinical practice guideline was to develop consensus on evidence-based recommendations for the optimal timing of TJA in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe OA or advanced symptomatic ON with secondary arthritis for whom
