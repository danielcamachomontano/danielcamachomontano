strongly recommended allopurinol as the preferred first-line agent given its efficacy when dosed appropriately (often required doses >300 mg/day 2 2 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ acr.24180/abstract The choice of either allopurinol or febuxostat over probenecid is strongly recommended for patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage ≥3). The choice of pegloticase as a first-line therapy is strongly recommended against. Starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥3] ) and febuxostat (≤40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended. Starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation Certainty of evidence For patients starting any ULT, we strongly recommend allopurinol over all
