than CYC. Fertility preservation in women with RMD treated with CYC. Although CYC is used less frequently than in the past due to availability of alternative treatments, it remains a mainstay of therapy for severe or life-threatening RMD. Ovarian insufficiency is a potential long-term complication of monthly intravenous CYC therapy. Hormonal co-therapy during the course of CYC is suggested to reduce risk of ovarian insufficiency. Fertility preservation with cyclophosphamide To prevent inducing primary ovarian insufficiency in premenopausal women with RMD receiving monthly intravenous CYC, we conditionally recommend monthly gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy. Ovarian insufficiency risk with CYC treatment depends on patient age and cumulative monthly CYC dose Thus far, studies have addressed gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy only in CYC-treated RMD patients who receive CYC monthly by intravenous administration. Acknowledging this lack of data on oral
