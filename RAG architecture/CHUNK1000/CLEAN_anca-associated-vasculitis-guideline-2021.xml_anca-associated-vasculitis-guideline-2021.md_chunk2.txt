Among European populations, prevalence ranges from 24 to 157 cases per million, with the highest prevalence reported in Sweden and the UK MPA is characterized histologically by vasculitis without granulomatous inflammation. Common clinical manifestations include rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage. MPA is most commonly associated with perinuclear ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase. The prevalence of MPA ranges from 0 to 66 cases per million among European countries and 86 cases per million in Japan EGPA is characterized histologically by eosinophilic tissue infiltration in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and peripheral neuropathy. Only 40% of patients produce detectable ANCA. The overall prevalence of EGPA in European populations has been estimated to range from 2 to 38 cases per million Prior to the use of alkylating agents, survival with these diseases
