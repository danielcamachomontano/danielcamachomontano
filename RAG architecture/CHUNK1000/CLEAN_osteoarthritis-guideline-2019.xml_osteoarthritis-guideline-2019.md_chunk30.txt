In clinical trials, the effect sizes for acetaminophen are very small, suggesting that few of those treated experience important benefit, and meta-analysis has suggested that use of acetamin ophen as monotherapy may be ineffective Duloxetine is conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA. While studied primarily in the knee, the effects of duloxetine may plausibly be expected to be similar for OA of the hip or hand. While a variety of centrally acting agents (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants) have been used in the management of
