recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Rituximab is favored based on the general desire to avoid re-treatment with cyclophosphamide if possible and on the findings of an observational study of rituximab in relapsing or refractory EGPA Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations after prior successful remission induction with rituximab, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over switching to cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Re-induction of remission with rituximab is favored over cyclophosphamide treatment to minimize toxicity. However, the duration of remission prior to the onset of relapse should be examined. Cyclophosphamide should be considered if a severe relapse occurred quickly after rituximab treatment, or if cardiac involvement is present (see ungraded position statement and recommendation on this topic). Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who
