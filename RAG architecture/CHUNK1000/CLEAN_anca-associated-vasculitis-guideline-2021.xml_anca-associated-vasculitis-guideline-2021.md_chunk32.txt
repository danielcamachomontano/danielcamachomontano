for active, severe disease Ungraded position statement: For patients with active, severe EGPA, either IV pulse glucocorticoids or high-dose oral glucocorticoids may be prescribed as initial therapy. There are no data to support favoring either IV pulse or highdose oral glucocorticoids over the other option in active, severe EGPA. Choosing an approach should be influenced by individual patient factors. In either instance, glucocorticoids should be combined with a nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agent such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab (see ungraded position statement below). Ungraded position statement: For patients with active, severe EGPA, either cyclophosphamide or rituximab may be prescribed for remission induction. Cyclophosphamide has been more commonly used for remission induction in patients with active, severe EGPA, given the experience with cyclophosphamide in other forms of vasculitis Recommendation: For patients with active, severe EGPA, we conditionally recommend
