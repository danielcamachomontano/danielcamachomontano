mofetil is recommended over rituximab, because there has been less experience with the use of rituximab for remission maintenance in EGPA. Rituximab could be considered if remission were induced with rituximab or if there are contraindications to other choices. Recommendation: For patients with severe EGPA whose disease has entered remission, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil over mepolizumab for remission maintenance. While there are limited data informing the use of remission maintenance therapy in EGPA, remission induction therapies (e.g., cyclophosphamide) should not be indefinitely continued given the potential toxicity. Thus, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil can be considered for remission maintenance based on experience in GPA/MPA, expert opinion, and results from small studies Ungraded position statement: The duration of glucocorticoid therapy in EGPA should be guided by the patient's clinical
