and results from small studies Ungraded position statement: The duration of glucocorticoid therapy in EGPA should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, values, and preferences. There is insufficient published evidence to support a specific duration of glucocorticoid treatment, and thus, the length of glucocorticoid therapy should be determined based on each patient's clinical circumstances. Many patients with EGPA require some treatment with glucocorticoids, generally at a low dose, to maintain control of asthma and allergy symptoms. The minimum effective dose should be prescribed to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. Treatment of disease relapse Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations after prior successful remission induction with cyclophosphamide, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Rituximab is favored based on the general desire to avoid
