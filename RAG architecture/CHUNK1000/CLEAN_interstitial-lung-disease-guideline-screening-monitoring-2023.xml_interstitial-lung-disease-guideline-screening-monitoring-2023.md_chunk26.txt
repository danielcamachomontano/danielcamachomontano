studies deviated from those intended for specific questions. Additionally, we did not have any available evidence to examine the relationship between frequency of screening or monitoring and subsequent outcomes. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence regarding the effects of screening or monitoring on specific subpopulations, such as racial and ethnic minority groups. Finally, we were unable to include other important affected patient groups because the scope of the guideline focused on diseases associated with higher risk of developing ILD. Pediatric patient guidelines were not included given the existing Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease treatment guidance. SLE was not included in this guideline because the treatment of lung involvement most often aligns with treatment of the underlying SLE. 23265205, 2024, 8, Downloaded from https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42860, Wiley Online Library on [02/08/2024].
