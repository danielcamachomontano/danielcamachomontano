Despite an expansion in the number of new therapies for PsA, there remains limited comparative efficacy/effectiveness evidence to inform treatment decisions.

The conditional recommendations convey that, although the suggested course of action will be best for many patients, there will be some patients in whom, considering their comorbidities and/or their values and preferences, the alternative represents the best choice. The guideline will be updated as new evidence from comparative studies becomes available. A Patient Panel meeting was held prior to the Voting Panel meeting to gain insight into patients' values and preferences for the pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic intervention comparisons being addressed. We recognize that patient preferences are an important part of our treatment recommendations.
