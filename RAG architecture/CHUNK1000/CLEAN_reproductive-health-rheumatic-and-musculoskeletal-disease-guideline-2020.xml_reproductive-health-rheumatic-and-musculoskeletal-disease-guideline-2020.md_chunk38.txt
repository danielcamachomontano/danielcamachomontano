therapy with low-dose aspirin and prophylactic heparin/LMWH, additional treatments are needed for patients who do not respond to standard therapy. Intravenous immunoglobuin, low-dose prednisone, increased dose of heparin/LMWH, and HCQ have all been suggested as additional or alternative treatments. We conditionally recommend against treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or an increased LMWH dose, as these have not been demonstrably helpful in cases of pregnancy loss despite standard therapy with low-dose aspirin and prophylactic heparin or LMWH. Prophylactic-dose heparin and aspirin therapy for OB APS improves likelihood of live birth, but not necessarily full-term birth. Pregnancy loss occurs, despite treatment, in 25% of OB APS pregnancies. There are no data demonstrating improved outcomes with a higher dose of heparin, and only anecdotal data support the use of intravenous immunoglobulin. We strongly recommend against adding prednisone to prophylactic-dose heparin or LMWH and
