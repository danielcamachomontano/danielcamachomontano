be at potentially higher risk of perioperative cardiac and/or thromboembolic events. Therefore, consideration of the role of comorbidities and the interaction with antirheumatic therapy should also be pursued. In summary, this guideline provides an update to the ACR/AAHKS 2017 guideline to provide clinicians and patients information about risks and benefits regarding management of perioperative antirheumatic medication to inform decisions prior to THA and TKA. We have updated our evidence base through our search of the current literature and assessed that information through the lens of our clinical expertise and the perspectives of the patients who have participated in this process. We acknowledge the gaps in our information base and intend to continue to fill those gaps as more research is available.
