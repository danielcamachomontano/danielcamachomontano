it during pregnancy; if she is not taking HCQ, we conditionally recommend starting it if there is no contraindication. Many studies support maternal and pregnancy benefit of HCQ and low risk for mother and fetus We conditionally recommend treating SLE patients with low-dose aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily), beginning in the first trimester. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and US Protective Health Task Force recommend aspirin 81 mg daily as prophylaxis in all patients at high risk for preeclampsia Because active disease affects maternal and pregnancy outcome, we strongly suggest, as good practice, monitoring SLE disease activity with clinical history, examination, and laboratory tests at least once per trimester. Abnormalities in the complete blood cell count, differential cell count, urinalysis results and urinary protein:creatinine ratio, or anti-DNA, C3, or C4 levels may indicate possible SLE flare and/or preeclampsia despite absence of clinical symptoms.
