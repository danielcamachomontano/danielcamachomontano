thromboembolism [VTE] and fatal stroke) and ROM (major myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) would often favor the other available options when possible. The panel emphasized the need for shared decision-making with patients to ensure they understand that some OP therapies (DEN, PTH/PTHrP, ROM) require another course of antiresorptive OP therapy to prevent rapid bone loss and vertebral fractures The use of OP medications in patients after kidney transplant and with CKD was addressed in this guideline. When eGFR <35 mL/min, the risk of renal osteodystrophy is significantly increased, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy. As such, MBD expert evaluation for CKD-MBD is conditionally recommended to exclude these conditions. Once excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM, but BP should be avoided. Use of DEN in this group may lead to prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia A
